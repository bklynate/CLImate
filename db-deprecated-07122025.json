It's a battle of southpaws this afternoon on Independence Day in Philadelphia. Andrew Abbott takes the mound for the Reds, while Jesús Luzardo gets the start for the Phillies. First pitch is at 1:05 PM EDT.\n\nThe Phillies are one of the best teams in the National League and in first place in the East division. The Phillies steal a lot of bases, 76 up to this point in the season, which is good for 4th in the NL. They can also pitch well. The Phillies have a team ERA of 3.71, and their pitchers have 801 strikeouts this season, tops in the NL and second in MLB behind the Astros.\n\n---\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds pitcher Andrew Abbott has struggled with a 6.9% walk rate, which limits runners on base, and also limits hard contact. His HardHit% is 32.6%, good for top 9% in baseball, but that is to be expected when he faces lefties significantly more than lefties.\n\n\n**Phillies vs. Reds Starting Pitcher Matchup - July 4 | AP News**\n\n\n\n**Reds vs Phillies Prediction, Pick, Odds for Friday, July 4**\nThe Philadelphia Phillies host the Cincinnati Reds on July 4, 2025.

His last outing? Solid - one run over five innings against the Padres - but the pitch count ballooned to 102, and he walked two batters for the first time in over a month.\n\n\"You want to stay around 15 pitches an inning,\" Abbott said. \"But you've just got to keep your foot down and grind.\"\n\nGrinding is a familiar concept in this part of the country. It's practically a civic duty. So is good pitching, which the Phillies have in abundance these days. Cristopher Sánchez added to the rotation's recent dominance on Wednesday night, carving up the Padres over seven innings in a 5-1 win. His performance followed a familiar script: minimal walks, soft contact, and quiet confidence.\n\n\"He's been just like the rest of them,\" Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. \"Just wonderful.\"\n\nNow it's Jesus Luzardo's turn. The southpaw gets the ball for Philadelphia and enters with a 7-4 record and a 4.06 ERA. His last time out against the Braves was a mixed bag - seven hits and three walks over five innings - but he limited Atlanta to just two runs.\n\nLuzardo's history against Cincinnati suggests he could settle in quickly. In two career starts against the Reds, he's posted a 1.64 ERA with 13 strikeouts and only one walk across 11 innings.\n\nThe Reds, though, aren't limping into town. They arrive fresh off an 8-4 comeback win in Boston, a game where Christian Encarnacion-Strand clubbed his first career grand slam and Matt McLain collected five hits in a day that spanned two ballgames - including a suspended game makeup.\n\n\"We did some good things,\" Reds skipper Terry Francona said. \"That comeback's going to make the plane ride a heckuva lot better.\"\n\nFriday marks the first meeting between the clubs this season.\n\n*_Pitching Matchups_**\n\nFriday: LHP Jesus Luzardo (7-4. 4.06) vs. LHP Andrew Abbot (7-1, 1.79)\n\nSaturday: LHP Ranger Suarez (7-2, 2.00) vs. LHP Nick Lodolo (5-5, 3.52)\n\nSunday: RHP Zack Wheeler (8-3, 2.26) vs. RHP Chase Burns (0-1, 13.50)\n\n*_Painter Update_**\n\nBack in Clearwater this spring, the Phillies made it clear: If everything broke right, Andrew Painter could find his way to the big-league rotation right around the All-Star break.\n\nWell, we're almost there.\n\nBut the picture isn't quite as clear anymore.\n\nWith Aaron Nola still on the injured list and Mick Abel struggling to find consistency, attention has naturally shifted back to Painter - the 6-foot-7 flamethrower who still carries the highest ceiling of any arm in the Phillies' system. But his latest outing for Triple-A Lehigh Valley served as a reminder that even prodigies hit speed bumps.\n\nFacing Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Wednesday, Painter allowed four runs on seven hits over five innings. He walked just one and struck out seven, generating an eye-popping 16 whiffs on 52 swings. But all four runs came in a rough fourth inning - the kind of inning that still stands between him and Citizens Bank Park.\n\nThere are encouraging signs. Painter threw 65 of his 95 pitches for strikes. He's challenging hitters. He's filling the zone. But Triple-A hasn't come as easily to him as the lower levels. Through 45 1/3 innings with the IronPigs, he's sporting a 4.57 ERA, a 1.43 WHIP, and a 52-to-19 strikeout-to-walk ratio.\n\nIs the stuff big-league caliber? No question. But the consistency still needs to catch up.\n\nSo while the All-Star break may have looked like a realistic target back in March, the Phillies now find themselves walking the tightrope between need and patience. Painter's day is coming - and it still may be soon - but for now, it's not quite today.\n\n\n**Review the Reds vs Phillies Match Preview and Winning Probability ...**\n![Cincinnati Reds logo](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org/2000/svg' style='width:auto;height:auto'%2F%3E)\n\n---\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds take on the Philadelphia Phillies on July 4, 2025.

It's a battle of southpaws this afternoon on Independence Day in Philadelphia. Andrew Abbott takes the mound for the Reds, while Jesús Luzardo gets the start for the Phillies. First pitch is at 1:05 PM EDT.\n\nThe Phillies are one of the best teams in the National League and in first place in the East division. The Phillies steal a lot of bases, 76 up to this point in the season, which is good for 4th in the NL. They can also pitch well. The Phillies have a team ERA of 3.71, and their pitchers have 801 strikeouts this season, tops in the NL and second in MLB behind the Astros.\n\n---\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds pitcher Andrew Abbott has struggled with a 6.9% walk rate, which limits runners on base, and also limits hard contact. His HardHit% is 32.6%, good for top 9% in baseball, but that is to be expected when he faces lefties significantly more than lefties.\n\n\n**Reds 9-6 Phillies (Jul 4, 2025) Game Recap - ESPN**\nYou will experience limited functionality and unusable pages with your current browser.

He's allowed one earned run or fewer in 12 of 14 starts with a 1.79 ERA. He is limiting hitters to a .203 average this year.\n-   Jesús Luzardo relies on swing-and-miss stuff, averaging 10.5 strikeouts per nine innings. His 4.06 ERA suggests occasional inconsistency, but a FIP of 2.75 signals that he is better than his ERA would lead you to believe.\n\n\n### Bullpen usage\n\nBoth teams have below average bullpens, with bullpen ERAs north of 4.00. But I'm not sure that either bullpen puts their team at a significant disadvantage with both of them struggling equally going into this game.\n\n\n### Recent team streaks\n\n-   Reds are 6-4 in their last 10 games, including a win in Boston sparked by a late grand slam from Christian Encarnacion‑Strand.\n-   Phillies are 5-5 over the same stretch, and have won three of their last four games going into this series opener.\n\n\n## Best Player Props\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n      \"Player\": \"Kyle Schwarber\",\n      \"Prop\": \"Over 0.5 RBI\",\n      \"Line\": \"+175\"\n    },\n      \"Player\": \"Andrew Abbott\",\n      \"Prop\": \"Over 4.5 K\",\n      \"Line\": \"-160\"\n      \"Player\": \"Jesús Luzardo\",\n      \"Prop\": \"Over 6.5 K\",\n      \"Line\": \"-110\"\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\n\n## Betting Trends & H2H\n\n-   Phillies are 28-15 at home and 42-24 as moneyline favorites this season.\n-   Reds are 28-23 as underdogs and hold the league's third-best win percentage as dogs this year.\n-   This is the first game of a six-game season series between these teams in 2025.\n\n\n## Reds vs Phillies Model Projection\n\nScore Projection: Cincinnati 3 - Philadelphia 4\n\nWin Probability: Cincinnati 41%, Philadelphia 59%\n\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nBoth starting pitchers have been excellent this year, especially Abbott. The under at 8.5 runs is a smart play given the likelihood of a low-scoring start to the game. Abbott's consistency and Luzardo's swing-and-miss stuff suggest that each starter will keep the opposing lineup in check. While the Phillies hold a slight edge at home, I find the under to carry more value than betting Philly in a game where a bullpen meltdown could come from either side late.\n\n* * *\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2048%2048%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nJay Sanin is a sports bettor, writer and broadcaster from New York.

He's allowed one earned run or fewer in 12 of 14 starts with a 1.79 ERA. He is limiting hitters to a .203 average this year.\n-   Jesús Luzardo relies on swing-and-miss stuff, averaging 10.5 strikeouts per nine innings. His 4.06 ERA suggests occasional inconsistency, but a FIP of 2.75 signals that he is better than his ERA would lead you to believe.\n\n\n### Bullpen usage\n\nBoth teams have below average bullpens, with bullpen ERAs north of 4.00. But I'm not sure that either bullpen puts their team at a significant disadvantage with both of them struggling equally going into this game.\n\n\n### Recent team streaks\n\n-   Reds are 6-4 in their last 10 games, including a win in Boston sparked by a late grand slam from Christian Encarnacion‑Strand.\n-   Phillies are 5-5 over the same stretch, and have won three of their last four games going into this series opener.\n\n\n## Best Player Props\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n      \"Player\": \"Kyle Schwarber\",\n      \"Prop\": \"Over 0.5 RBI\",\n      \"Line\": \"+175\"\n    },\n      \"Player\": \"Andrew Abbott\",\n      \"Prop\": \"Over 4.5 K\",\n      \"Line\": \"-160\"\n      \"Player\": \"Jesús Luzardo\",\n      \"Prop\": \"Over 6.5 K\",\n      \"Line\": \"-110\"\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\n\n## Betting Trends & H2H\n\n-   Phillies are 28-15 at home and 42-24 as moneyline favorites this season.\n-   Reds are 28-23 as underdogs and hold the league's third-best win percentage as dogs this year.\n-   This is the first game of a six-game season series between these teams in 2025.\n\n\n## Reds vs Phillies Model Projection\n\nScore Projection: Cincinnati 3 - Philadelphia 4\n\nWin Probability: Cincinnati 41%, Philadelphia 59%\n\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nBoth starting pitchers have been excellent this year, especially Abbott. The under at 8.5 runs is a smart play given the likelihood of a low-scoring start to the game. Abbott's consistency and Luzardo's swing-and-miss stuff suggest that each starter will keep the opposing lineup in check. While the Phillies hold a slight edge at home, I find the under to carry more value than betting Philly in a game where a bullpen meltdown could come from either side late.\n\n* * *\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2048%2048%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nJay Sanin is a sports bettor, writer and broadcaster from New York.

The Dodgers have the best record in the National League and have the highest score in the league. The Brewers sit in second place in the NL Central and in the second Wild Card spot. The Los Angeles Angels Angels host the Brewers on Monday night.\n\n---\n\nFreddy Peralta and Yoshinobu Yamamoto will go head-to-head against each other this week. Jose Quintana and Jose Cuadrado will go up against each of the teams. Jose Cuarrado, Jose Cuerrado and Jose Benez will pitch against each others.\n\n\n**Los Angeles Dodgers vs Milwaukee Brewers Pick - 7/7/2025**\nThe Dodgers head to Milwaukee to face the Brewers on Monday night. Entering the final week before the All-Star break, the Dodgers have the best record in the National League this year, while the Brewers are firmly in playoff contention themselves. Here, I break down this marquee matchup in the National League and make my Dodgers vs Brewers prediction from Milwaukee.\n\n---\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers play the Milwaukee Brewers in the first game of the MLB season. The game is scheduled to be played on July 7 at 7.30 p.m. ET. The Dodgers are looking to bounce back from three straight losses against the Houston Astros. The Brewers are looking for a win over the Dodgers.\n\n\n**Dodgers vs. Brewers Prediction, Odds, Probable Pitchers and Prop Bets ...**\nA weekend series against the Houston Astros didn't go the way the Los Angeles Dodgers' had hoped. The potential World Series preview ended in a three-game sweep by the Astros.\n\nLuckily for Los Angeles, it still is in no danger of losing the top spot in the NL West West, holding a seven-game lead on the Padres and the Giants. The Dodgers will begin this week with a three-game series against the Milwaukee Brewers, who are desperately trying to catch the Chicago Cubs atop the NL Central. Ahead of tonight's opener, the Brewers are just four games back.\n\nLet's take a look at the odds and my best bets for tonight's National League showdown.\n\n[_Odds via Caesars Sportsbook_](https://bit.ly/42IKuzA)\n\n*Run Line**\n\n*Moneyline**\n\n*Total**\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto has had some issues with his command this season, walking 3.0 batters per nine innings pitched this season, including allowed five walks against the Giants back on June 13. Let's try to take advantage of that by betting the OVER on his walks allowed tonight. The Brewers have the eighth-highest walk rate over the past 30 days, drawing a walk on 8.8% of their plate appearances.\n\nIn today's edition of [Walk-Off Wagers](https://www.si.com/betting/mlb-best-bets-today-bet-padres-in-yu-darvish-s-2025-debut), I broke down why I'm backing the Brewers as underdogs tonight:\n\n_The Los Angeles Dodgers have struggled a bit, compared to their usual dominant selves. Their offense is just ninth in OPS over the past 30 days (.758), which is behind the Brewers, who come in at seventh in that stat at .761. Over the past two weeks, the Dodgers have been even worse offensively, ranking just 14th in OPS in that time frame at .715._\n\n_Yoshinobu Yamamoto gets the start for the Dodgers tonight, but he will be matched by Freddy Peralta of the Brewers, both of whom have sub-3.00 ERAs. The Brewers do have an advantage when it comes to their bullpen. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Dodgers has been their relievers, which rank 24th in the Majors in bullpen ERA at 4.46._\n\n_With the Brewers at home tonight, I think there's some value on them as underdogs at +115._\n\n_**Pick:**_ [_**Brewers +115**_](https://bit.ly/42IKuzA)\n\nUse our exclusive Caesars Sportsbook promo code SICZRDYW to [**double your winnings on your next 10 bets****.**](https://bit.ly/42IKuzA) Simply deposit $10 or more and place a first-time wager of at least $1, and Caesars will give you 10 100% profit boost tokens.\n\n_**Odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.**_\n\n_**If you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.**_\n\nYou can check out all of [Iain's bets here](https://betstamp.app/u/iainmacbets)!\n\n\n**Dodgers vs. Brewers odds, tips and betting trends**\n![logo](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/sitelogos/m-oc.svg)\n\nusatoday.com wants to ensure the best experience for all of our readers, so we built our site to take advantage of the latest technology, making it faster and easier to use.\n\nUnfortunately, your browser is not supported.

Begin by identifying the projected starting pitchers for each team, then analyze each pitcher's recent form, strikeout trends, historical averages, and past performance against today's opposing team to clearly estimate strikeout totals, briefly explaining your reasoning. Next, select 1–2 hitters from each team who you believe are most likely to record at least one hit, based on recent batting averages and form, left/right pitcher matchup splits, and historical performance against the opposing pitcher. After providing the current runline and moneyline for this game, evaluate both lines using your pitcher and hitter analysis to determine which side of each line (runline and moneyline) offers the greatest betting value, clearly explaining your reasoning. Finally, construct a thoughtful, data-supported 3-leg parlay combining a strikeout-related outcome for one starting pitcher, a hitter-related outcome (a selected hitter to record at least one hit), and your chosen best-value pick (runline or moneyline).

Over that span, the team ranks eighth in the MLB with a 114 wRC+.\n\nThe Angels also do better against right-handed pitchers. Granted, his opponent today isn't any righty but deGrom. However, deGrom's splits show he has a higher ERA on the road and at night, both conditions met in this game.\n\nMore important is the declining [Rangers](https://www.actionnetwork.com/mlb/odds/texas-rangers) offense ranking 24th over the last two weeks with a 85 wRC+ and 27th in slugging with a mere .352.\n\nThe Rangers don't do well against left-handed pitchers (27th wRC+ and 28th in slugging), and they'll have to face L.A.'s Kikuchi, who holds a 2.32 ERA in his last seven starts.\n\nThis aligns with the Bet Labs recommendation to back an upset tonight using the Low Support Division Dog system.\n\n\n## Rangers vs Angels Prediction, Betting Analysis\n\nthe number of bets compared to the day's average is between 1.01 and 3.94\n\nthe moneyline change from open to close is between -200 and 0\n\nthe moneyline % is between 8% and 29%\n\nthe game is played during the Regular season\n\nthe game is a Division game\n\nThis system targets divisional underdogs in MLB regular-season games that receive low public support but show signs of sharp action or value.\n\nThese dogs have moneyline support from less than 30% of bettors yet still experience little or no negative line movement, suggesting the smart money is holding the line.\n\nAdditionally, these bets occur in division games, where familiarity and tighter matchups often reduce the gap between the underdog and favorite.\n\nThe bet count is modestly above average, further hinting at targeted action rather than mass public overreaction.\n\n*Pick: Angels ML (+115, [BetMGM](https://www.actionnetwork.com/online-sports-betting/reviews/betmgm))**\n\n[![Action PRO Upsell Image](https://assets.actionnetwork.com/736824_ActionPRO_promo_1500x844.jpg)](https://www.actionnetwork.com/pricing?intcmp=ArticleProCard&intcid=603682546)\n\nPremium picks, tools & analysis\n\nTrack & follow smart money\n\nBiggest player prop edges\n\nReal-time expert pick alerts\n\n\n### Rangers vs Angels Betting Trends\n\n\n### Rangers vs Angels Weather\n\n![Author Profile](https://images.actionnetwork.com/blog/2019/11/check-100x100.png)\n\nMust be 21+.

Let's take a look at the prediction for this MLB matchup.\n\n*Texas Rangers Betting Preview**\n\nThe Texas Rangers (44-46, 18-27 Away) have been in a hot and cold form recently. After beating the Baltimore Orioles at home, they opened a three-series road trip with a loss to the San Diego Padres. In a rubber match on Sunday, the Rangers fell to a 4-1 defeat. Cory Seager drove in the lone run for Texas, while Jack Leiter took the loss after allowing two runs on five hits with five strikeouts and two walks in 3.2 innings.\n\nThis year, the Rangers average 3.78 runs per game (25th in the MLB) on a .228/.296/.366 triple-slash. When it comes to pitching, the Rangers' staff has a 3.23 ERA (1st) and 1.16 WHIP (2nd). Adolis Garcia leads the Rangers with a .228 batting average, ten home runs, and 49 RBI this season.\n\nThe projected starting pitcher for the Rangers is Jacob deGrom, who is 9-2 in 17 starts this season, with a 2.13 ERA and 0.89 WHIP in 101.1 innings.\n\n*Los Angeles Angels Betting Preview**\n\nThe Los Angeles Angels (43-46, 20-20 Home) are back home from two series on the road, where they defeated the Atlanta Braves and were swept at the hands of the Toronto Blue Jays. Following a couple of extra-inning losses, the Angels fell short in Game 3 as well, losing 3-2. Tyler Anderson took the loss after allowing three runs on eight hits with two strikeouts and two walks in 5.0 innings.\n\nThis season, the Angels average 4.26 runs per game (17th in the MLB) on a .228/.298/.404 triple-slash. When it comes to pitching, the Angels' staff has a 4.47 ERA (24th) and 1.44 WHIP (28th). Taylor Ward leads the Angels with a .228 batting average, 20 home runs, and 59 RBI this season.\n\nYusei Kikuchi will take the mound for the Angels on Monday. The 34-year-old left-hander has a 3-6 record in 18 starts this year with a 2.81 ERA and 1.37 WHIP in 102.1 innings.\n\n*Total Runs Facts**\n\nEach of the Angels' last four games have gone UNDER the total runs line.\nFour of the Rangers' last five games as road favorites have gone UNDER the total runs line.\nThe 'Inning 1 UNDER 0.5 runs' market has hit in each of the Rangers' last five games against American League opponents.\nThe 'Inning 1 UNDER 0.5 runs' market has hit in four of the Angels' last five night games at Angel Stadium of Anaheim.\n\n*Matchup/League Facts**\n\nThe Angels rank 29th in the league for steals this season (40).\nThe Angels rank 29th in the league for walks allowed this season (341).\nThe Rangers rank 1st in the league for runs allowed this season (315).\nThe Rangers rank 3rd in the league for opponent batting average this season (.228).\n\n*Rangers vs Angels Prediction**\n\nThe Rangers won nine of the previous ten H2H encounters, including the last eight, while this season, Texas swept the Angels in three games back in April. All three of those duels went Under, and I am going with another low-scoring affair because of the pitching matchup. Jacob deGrom hasn't allowed more than two runs in his last 14 starts, while Yusei Kikuchi surrendered more than two runs only twice in his previous 12 starts. Kikuchi faced the Rangers this year and allowed one run in 6.0 innings in Texas's 4-0 win. Back the Under.\n\n\n### Oliver Zivic's Pick: Under 7.5\n\n\n**Rangers vs. Angels: Game 1 prediction, lineup, odds, injuries, and ...**\n![MLB: Baltimore Orioles at Texas Rangers - Source: Imagn](https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/07/26571783-1751878519.jpeg?w=640)\n\nRangers vs. Angels: Game 1 prediction, lineup, odds, injuries, and picks - July 7, 2025 - Source: Imagn\n\n![close](https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/cmc-predictor/v2/cross-icon.png?w=40)\n\nThe [Rangers](https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/texas-rangers) and [Angels](https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/los-angeles-angels) open a four-game set tonight at Angel Stadium, and this one's built for drama. Texas sends their ace [Jacob deGrom](https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/jacob-degrom) to the hill, while the Angels counter with savvy southpaw Yusei Kikuchi, who's quietly been lights-out in Anaheim with a sharp 1.31 ERA at home.\n\nToss in big-swing threats like Jo Adell and [Adolis Garcia](https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/adolis-garcia), and you've got the recipe for a tight, grind-it-out Game 1, the kind of matchup where one mistake or clutch swing could tilt the balance in a series carrying serious postseason weight.\n\n* * *\n\n---\n\n## Pitcher & Hitter Matchups\n\n\n### Starting Pitchers\n\n\n#### Jacob deGrom (Rangers)\n\nAt age 37, DeGrom is looking like a strategic pitching savant, dialing back his fastball velocity to around 97 mph while leaning more on his slider and off-speed mix to preserve his health post-Tommy John surgery.\n\nHe's 9‑2 with a stellar 2.13 ERA, 0.89 WHIP, and 100 strikeouts in just over 101 innings.\n\n\n#### Yusei Kikuchi (Angels)\n\nKikuchi has been a surprisingly tough lefty for the Angels, working to a 3‑6 record but an impressive 2.81 ERA, 1.37 WHIP and 106 strikeouts in just over 102 innings.\n\nHis performance at Angel Stadium has been especially strong, with only a 1.12 ERA at home over eight starts, he enters tonight with momentum, coming off strong starts against the [Red Sox](https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/boston-red-sox) and [Braves](https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/atlanta-braves), including a season-high 12-strikeout performance.\n\n\n### Hitters to Watch\n\n\n#### Jo Adell (Angels)\n\nAdell has been one of the few steady bright spots in the Angels' lineup this season. Batting .248 with 19 homers and 52 RBIs, the 25-year-old outfielder continues to show the raw power that made him a top prospect.\n\n\n#### Adolis Garcia (Rangers)\n\nWhile it's been a streaky season for Garcia, he remains one of the Rangers' most dangerous bats when he gets locked in.\n\nSlashing .228 with 10 homers, 49 RBIs and eight stolen bases, Garcia has shown the ability to change games with one swing or swipe a crucial bag, which makes him a constant threat. With DeGrom likely working a low-scoring outing, Garcia's knack for delivering clutch hits could be a deciding factor tonight.\n\n\n\n## Projected Lineups\n\n\n### Texas Rangers (Away Team)\n\n-   2B Marcus Semien (R)\n-   LF Wyatt Langford (R)\n-   SS Corey Seager (L)\n-   RF Adolis Garcia (R)\n-   1B Jake Burger (R)\n-   DH Jonah Heim (S)\n-   C Kyle Higashioka (R)\n-   3B Ezequiel Duran (R)\n-   CF Sam Haggerty (S)\n-   SP: Jacob deGrom (R) - 9-2, 2.13 ERA\n\n\n### Los Angeles Angels (Home Team)\n\n-   SS Zach Neto (R)\n-   1B Nolan Schanuel (L)\n-   DH Mike Trout (R)\n-   LF Taylor Ward (R)\n-   CF Jo Adell (R)\n-   RF Jorge Soler (R)\n-   C Logan O'Hoppe (R)\n-   3B Luis Rengifo (S)\n-   2B Kevin Newman (R)\n-   SP: Yusei Kikuchi (L) - 3-6, 2.81 ERA\n\n\n\n## Injury Report\n\n\n### Texas Rangers\n\n-   Joc Pederson (hand) - 10-day IL, out through mid-July\n-   Tyler Mahle (shoulder) - 15-day IL\n-   Josh Sborz (shoulder) - 60-day IL\n-   Cody Bradford (elbow) - out for the season\n-   Jon Gray (wrist) - 60-day IL since March\n\n\n### Los Angeles Angels\n\n-   Yoan Moncada (knee) - 10-day IL, on rehab\n-   Chris Taylor (hand) - 10-day IL\n-   Christian Moore (thumb) - 10-day IL\n-   Robert Stephenson (biceps) - 15-day IL\n-   Ben Joyce (shoulder), and Anthony Rendon (hip) - are both out for the season\n\n\n\n## Current Odds\n\n-   Rangers Runline (−1.5): +118\n-   Angels Runline (+1.5): −143\n-   Over 7.5: −109\n-   Under 7.5: −112\n-   Rangers Moneyline: −157\n-   Angels Moneyline: +129\n\n\n\n## Best Bets & Prediction\n\n*Score Prediction**: Rangers 4, Angels 2\n\n\n### Top Bets\n\n1.  Rangers Moneyline (−157) - deGrom's elite season and home dominance give Texas the edge.\n2.  Under 7.5 runs (−112) - deGrom vs. Kikuchi spells low scoring, and both limit hard contact.\n\n*Value Parlay**: Rangers ML + Under 7.5 - combines an elite starter with a tight run total, solid payout with low risk.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\nThank You for feedback\n\nAbout the author\n\n![Shubham Soni](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg width='100' height='100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><rect width='100' height='100' style='fill:rgb(128, 128, 128);'/></svg>)\n\nShubham Soni is a dedicated baseball journalist at Sportkeeda with a deep passion for Major League Baseball.

That makes tonight's contest crucial for each team. A series win in SoCal prior to the All-Star break would go a long way towards a playoff push. Which of these West Coast clubs will gain some momentum in Anaheim? Below, I've laid out my preview, prediction, and best bet for Saturday's matchup between the Diamondbacks and the Angels.\n\nThe Angels are **[favorites (-123)opens in a new tab](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/event/ari-diamondbacks-%40-la-angels/32515599)** over the Diamondbacks, with the **[over/under set at 8.5 runsopens in a new tab](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/event/ari-diamondbacks-%40-la-angels/32515599)**. Let's break down which side has the edge on **[DraftKings Sportsbookopens in a new tab](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/)** entering tonight's contest.\n\n---\n\n## Diamondbacks vs. Angels prediction, preview\n\nWhile clubs such as the [Braves](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/teams/baseball/mlb/atlanta-braves--odds?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=268040&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork), [Rangers](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/teams/baseball/mlb/texas-rangers--odds?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=268040&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork) and [Orioles](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/teams/baseball/mlb/baltimore-orioles--odds?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=268040&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork) have generated headlines, the Diamondbacks have been equally disappointing. The team's fourth-place ranking doesn't make much sense on paper. Arizona is averaging 5.08 runs per game, the fourth-highest mark in baseball. That alone should be enough to keep this squad in contention for a wild card spot. Unfortunately for the Snakes, quality contributions on the mound have been virtually non-existent. Granted, season-ending Tommy John surgery for Corbin Burnes was bad luck. However, that's still no excuse for surrendering the league's fourth-most runs (477) this season.\n\nOne of the biggest culprits for the Diamondbacks has been Zac Gallen. Once an All-Star Game starter, the righty has looked like a shell of himself in 2025. Through 110.0 innings of work, the 29-year-old has put up an abysmal 5.15 ERA. With that being said, Arizona's former ace has finally gotten into a groove. Over two starts in July, Gallen has surrendered just one earned run (0.69 ERA). The biggest key for the veteran will be limiting the long ball; his 1.6 HR/9 ratio is a career-worst mark. That's not ideal going into tonight's matchup. Los Angeles has launched 138 dingers, fifth-most in baseball. However, the Angels have posted the league's fifth-worst batting average against right-handed pitchers (.234).\n\nSilencing a formidable Diamondbacks offense is crucial for Los Angeles. Fortunately for the Halos, staff ace Yusei Kikuchi is getting the nod tonight. Signed this offseason, the Japanese hurler has been a savior for an otherwise subpar starting rotation. Over 107.1 innings pitched, the two-time All-Star has delivered a 3.02 ERA and 110 strikeouts. Still, the southpaw will have his work cut out for him on Saturday. Since June 20th, Arizona has notched a league-best .887 OPS against lefties. Kikuchi's 4.0 BB/9 ratio is also troubling, as the D-Backs have generated baseball's third-most walks per game (3.59).\n\n\n## Diamondbacks vs. Angels pick, best bet\n\n\n### [Best Bet: Diamondbacks ML (+101)opens in a new tab](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/event/ari-diamondbacks-%40-la-angels/32515599)\n\n_In terms of talent, Gallen vs. Kikuchi is fairly even. Regardless, even if Arizona's starter puts up a clunker, this offense is capable of picking up the slack. In many ways, the Diamondbacks are a brutal opponent for the Angels and their ace. At even money, the Snakes make sense as a road dog._\n\n\n**Angels vs Diamondbacks Expert Pick and Prediction - July 12**\n![Arizona Diamondbacks at Los Angeles Angels 07/12/25 - MLB Picks & Predictions](https://res.cloudinary.com/pnp-staging/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto/v1752280847/sports-articles/68711957d8ebe172a44e46d40.25727642336651724.jpg)\n\n*Game Start:** 7/13/2025, 1:38 AM UTC\n\n*Latest Odds:** LAA -110 ; O/U 8.5\n\n---\n\n## Diamondbacks vs Angels Prediction\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks (46-48) travel to face the Los Angeles Angels (45-48) at Angel Stadium, July 12, at 7:38 PM ET. Both teams are coming off losses, with Arizona falling short 4-3 against San Diego and the Angels getting routed 11-4 by Texas. Zac Gallen (7-9, 5.15 ERA) matches up against Yusei Kikuchi (3-6, 3.02 ERA) on the mound tonight. Elevate your MLB game with our top-notch [MLB picks](https://freepicks.picksandparlays.net/more-free-picks/mlb-picks).\n\nArizona dropped a close contest in San Diego, continuing its inconsistency by alternating wins and losses through the last five games. Despite scoring three runs, the offense couldn't capitalize late, showcasing familiar struggles with clutch hitting, a season-long concern that's kept the club hovering around .500.\n\nPitching remains problematic for Arizona, evidenced by a team ERA of 4.61 and allowing 798 hits in 94 games. Pitching has faltered frequently, magnified tonight with Gallen's inflated 5.15 ERA and 20 home runs allowed. Offensive consistency hinges significantly on Eugenio Suarez, who leads the Diamondbacks with 29 homers and 75 RBIs but will need extra support to secure wins consistently.\n\nThe Angels also come into this matchup struggling to maintain any consistency. After alternating wins and losses over the last five, Los Angeles was embarrassed 11-4 at home against Texas in the previous game. Offensive inconsistency continues to plague Los Angeles, as shown by scoring just one run two games ago and exploding for 11 runs in the next contest.\n\nPitching is similarly inconsistent, with an inflated 4.66 team ERA and opponents hitting .264 against the Angels at night. However, Yusei Kikuchi offers hope, providing stability on the mound with a respectable 3.02 ERA and 110 strikeouts through 107.1 innings pitched. Offensively, Taylor Ward remains the Angels' primary run producer, leading with 21 home runs and 63 RBIs.\n\n\n## Diamondbacks vs Angels Pick Analysis\n\nGiven Gallen's struggles, specifically a 5.15 ERA and 20 home runs surrendered, the Angels hold an advantage. Yusei Kikuchi's consistency and strong ERA (3.02) significantly contrast with the Diamondbacks' pitching issues. Considering Arizona's hitting difficulties and Los Angeles' slight edge offensively at home, expect the Angels to exploit Gallen and edge this contest. Final Score Prediction: Angels win 6-4.\n\n\n## Betting Trends for Los Angeles Angels vs Arizona Diamondbacks\n\n![](https://raketech.static.api.areyouwatchingthis.com/images/teams/80x80/13375.png)\n\nDiamondbacks\n\nArizona is 5-10 in the last 15 games\n\nThe total has finished over in 10 of Arizona's last 15 games\n\n![](https://raketech.static.api.areyouwatchingthis.com/images/teams/80x80/7071.png)\n\nAngels\n\nLos Angeles is 2-5 in the last seven games\n\nThe total has finished over in four of Los Angeles' last five games\n\n\n## Our Free MLB Pick for Los Angeles Angels vs Arizona Diamondbacks\n\n![Picked Team Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/pnp-staging/image/upload/v1698350828/pnp-icon-52x52.png)\n\nLos Angeles Angels -110\n\n\n**Diamondbacks at Angels: Lineups, How to Watch, Predictions, and More**\nThe Angels will give the ball to Griffin Canning against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Saturday. The team is also hoping for Jose Soriano to pitch in hopes of converting the 25-year-old reliever into a starter.\n\nManager Ron Washington [told reporters](https://www.mlb.com/angels/news/reid-detmers-strikes-out-two-in-angels-spring-debut) that Soriano, a starting pitcher in the minors prior to a 2020 elbow injury, has the stuff to make the conversion. Last year he threw four pitches: a curveball, a sinker, a four-seamer and a slider. Some starting pitchers are able to have success with three, so you don't have to squint to see the Angels' logic here.\n\nWashington said Soriano [will have a chance to throw three innings.](https://www.ocregister.com/2024/03/01/angels-reid-detmers-confident-he-will-fulfill-his-potential/)\n\nCanning will face off against left-hander Logan Allen, who's making his second Cactus League start in his own bid to make the Diamondbacks' rotation.\n\n---\n\n### Lineups\n\n> - Los Angeles Angels (@Angels) [March 2, 2024](https://twitter.com/Angels/status/1763967640064999788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n\n### How to Watch\n\nBally Sports West will broadcast the game for the Angels.

Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte in MLB action.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks are in Anaheim to open a three-game set tonight against the Los Angeles Angels, each team's final series before All-Star weekend.\n\nBoth teams can certainly use momentum heading into the break, as each sits in fourth place in its division. The D-Backs are pegged as -125 moneyline favorites in the MLB odds.\n\nOur Diamondbacks vs. Angels predictions and free [MLB picks](https://www.covers.com/picks/mlb) believe the visitors have the advantage due to the pitching matchup.\n\n---\n\n## Diamondbacks vs Angels prediction\n\n*My Diamondbacks vs Angels best bet**: Diamondbacks moneyline ([\\-120 at bet365](https://www.covers.com/betting/sportsbookredirect?vertical=betting&location=editorial&slug=bet365))\n\nThe [Arizona Diamondbacks](https://www.covers.com/sport/baseball/mlb/teams/main/arizona-diamondbacks/odds) have alternated between wins and losses in seven straight games after Thursday's 4-3 loss to the Padres. They're hoping converted reliever [Ryne Nelson](https://www.covers.com/sport/baseball/mlb/players/247111/ryne-nelson) can deliver a win in the series opener.\n\nNelson is 5-2 with a 3.39 ERA in nine starts this season. He's allowed one earned run or less in six of his last eight starts.\n\nHe should be helped along as the D-Backs boast the fourth-highest scoring offense in baseball, putting up 5.09 runs per game.\n\n[Los Angeles Angels](https://www.covers.com/sport/baseball/mlb/teams/main/los-angeles-angels/odds) SP [Tyler Anderson](https://www.covers.com/sport/baseball/mlb/players/15210/tyler-anderson) will have to deal with those bats. He's coming off a 3-2 loss to the Blue Jays, allowing eight hits and three earned runs over five innings.\n\nHe's surrendered three or more runs in five of his last seven outings and is 2-6 with a 4.19 ERA.\n\nBut Anderson is far from the only pitcher struggling: the Angels have dropped five of their last seven, and the team owns the fifth-worst ERA in baseball (4.66).\n\nArizona is one of four teams with a winning road record in the National League, and I expect them to take advantage of the struggling Angels' pitching staff draw first blood in the series.\n\n\n## Diamondbacks vs Angels same-game parlay (SGP)\n\n[![bet365 Logo](https://images.covers.com/betting/sportsbooks/2/bet365.png)](https://www.covers.com/betting/sportsbookredirect?vertical=betting&location=editorial&slug=bet365)\n\nDiamondbacks moneyline\n\nKetel Marte 3+ hits + runs + RBI\n\nCorbin Carroll Over 1.5 total bases\n\n[Ketel Marte](https://www.covers.com/sport/baseball/mlb/players/13976/ketel-marte) has been a wrecking ball against Anderson, so we're tagging him for a big game against the Angels on Friday.\n\nIn 30 career at-bats against Anderson, Marte is hitting .433 with six doubles, two home runs, and four RBI. The second baseman should be in the mix to pick up any combination of three hits, runs, and RBI.\n\nWe'll wrap with Arizona leadoff man [Corbin Carroll](https://www.covers.com/sport/baseball/mlb/players/194333/corbin-carroll), who has a gettable 1.5 total bases line Friday.\n\nCarroll hit his 21st homer against the Padres on Thursday, giving him at least two total bases in three of the last four games.\n\n\n## Diamondbacks vs Angels odds\n\n\n### Diamondbacks vs Angels live odds\n\n\n### Diamondbacks vs Angels opening odds\n\n-   **Moneyline**: Arizona -117 | Los Angeles +106\n-   **Run line**: Arizona -1.5 | Los Angeles +1.5\n-   **Over/Under**: Over 9.5 | Under 9.5\n\n\n## Diamondbacks vs Angels trend\n\nL.A.'s last seven home games have gone Over the total.

Friday's game was tight, with the Angels edging out a 6-5 win, so this Saturday matchup carries a little extra weight. You've got two inconsistent squads with shaky bullpens and suspect recent form. Arizona's dropped three of its last four; L.A. is 3-2 in that same stretch but has been tough to trust long-term. For those digging into [**premium sports picks**](https://members.tonyspicks.com/), this is one of those games where recent performance, pitching matchups, and total trends need close attention - especially with both lineups flashing power but lacking consistency.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n      \"0\": \"Arizona Diamondbacks vs. Los Angeles Angels Game Info and Odds\"\n    },\n      \"0\": \"When:\",\n      \"1\": \"Saturday, July 12, 2025 at 9:38 PM ET\"\n      \"0\": \"Where:\",\n      \"1\": \"Angel Stadium\"\n      \"0\": \"Watch:\",\n      \"1\": \"ARID, FDSNW\"\n      \"0\": \"Diamondbacks odds:\",\n      \"1\": \"-110\"\n      \"0\": \"Angels odds:\",\n      \"0\": \"Total Line:\",\n      \"1\": \"8.5\"\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\n---\n\nThe Los Angeles Angels have been struggling in recent weeks. The Diamondbacks have been in the bottom of the league for the past two seasons. The Angels have struggled with injuries, but have been good at home. The team's pitching has been a problem since the start of the season. The Dodgers have struggled to find their footing in recent months.\n\n\n**Arizona Diamondbacks at Los Angeles Angels prediction, pick for ...**\nBryan Armetta offers up a preview, prediction and pick for Saturday's game between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nBoth the [Diamondbacks](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/teams/baseball/mlb/arizona-diamondbacks--odds?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=268040&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork) and [Angels](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/teams/baseball/mlb/los-angeles-angels--odds?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=268040&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork) sit just below .500, with records of 46-49 and 46-48, respectively. That makes tonight's contest crucial for each team. A series win in SoCal prior to the All-Star break would go a long way towards a playoff push. Which of these West Coast clubs will gain some momentum in Anaheim? Below, I've laid out my preview, prediction, and best bet for Saturday's matchup between the Diamondbacks and the Angels.\n\nThe Angels are **[favorites (-123)opens in a new tab](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/event/ari-diamondbacks-%40-la-angels/32515599)** over the Diamondbacks, with the **[over/under set at 8.5 runsopens in a new tab](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/event/ari-diamondbacks-%40-la-angels/32515599)**. Let's break down which side has the edge on **[DraftKings Sportsbookopens in a new tab](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/)** entering tonight's contest.\n\n---\n\n## Diamondbacks vs. Angels prediction, preview\n\nWhile clubs such as the [Braves](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/teams/baseball/mlb/atlanta-braves--odds?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=268040&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork), [Rangers](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/teams/baseball/mlb/texas-rangers--odds?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=268040&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork) and [Orioles](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/teams/baseball/mlb/baltimore-orioles--odds?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=268040&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork) have generated headlines, the Diamondbacks have been equally disappointing. The team's fourth-place ranking doesn't make much sense on paper. Arizona is averaging 5.08 runs per game, the fourth-highest mark in baseball. That alone should be enough to keep this squad in contention for a wild card spot. Unfortunately for the Snakes, quality contributions on the mound have been virtually non-existent. Granted, season-ending Tommy John surgery for Corbin Burnes was bad luck. However, that's still no excuse for surrendering the league's fourth-most runs (477) this season.\n\nOne of the biggest culprits for the Diamondbacks has been Zac Gallen. Once an All-Star Game starter, the righty has looked like a shell of himself in 2025. Through 110.0 innings of work, the 29-year-old has put up an abysmal 5.15 ERA. With that being said, Arizona's former ace has finally gotten into a groove. Over two starts in July, Gallen has surrendered just one earned run (0.69 ERA). The biggest key for the veteran will be limiting the long ball; his 1.6 HR/9 ratio is a career-worst mark. That's not ideal going into tonight's matchup. Los Angeles has launched 138 dingers, fifth-most in baseball. However, the Angels have posted the league's fifth-worst batting average against right-handed pitchers (.234).\n\nSilencing a formidable Diamondbacks offense is crucial for Los Angeles. Fortunately for the Halos, staff ace Yusei Kikuchi is getting the nod tonight. Signed this offseason, the Japanese hurler has been a savior for an otherwise subpar starting rotation. Over 107.1 innings pitched, the two-time All-Star has delivered a 3.02 ERA and 110 strikeouts. Still, the southpaw will have his work cut out for him on Saturday. Since June 20th, Arizona has notched a league-best .887 OPS against lefties. Kikuchi's 4.0 BB/9 ratio is also troubling, as the D-Backs have generated baseball's third-most walks per game (3.59).\n\n\n## Diamondbacks vs. Angels pick, best bet\n\n\n### [Best Bet: Diamondbacks ML (+101)opens in a new tab](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/event/ari-diamondbacks-%40-la-angels/32515599)\n\n_In terms of talent, Gallen vs. Kikuchi is fairly even. Regardless, even if Arizona's starter puts up a clunker, this offense is capable of picking up the slack. In many ways, the Diamondbacks are a brutal opponent for the Angels and their ace. At even money, the Snakes make sense as a road dog._\n\n\n**Arizona Diamondbacks vs Los Angeles Angels Prediction, 7/13/2025 MLB ...**\nThe Los Angeles Angels take on the Arizona Diamondbacks at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, California, on Sunday.

Both squads games are going over the total roughly 54% of the time and this matchup will see two starting pitchers in shaky form taking the bump. Zac Gallen (5.15 ERA, 1.35 WHIP) has been inconsistent all season, falling in the 3rd percentile in pitching run value with the highest ERA of his career by far over a large sample size. The Angels offense has been solid as of late, ranking 10th in wRC+ over the last 14 days.\n\nAs for L.A. starter Yusei Kikuchi (3.02 ERA, 1.38 WHIP), he's currently posting a 5.06 ERA in July compared to a solid 2.25 mark in June. The Diamondbacks have been quite formidable against lefties, ranking top-10 in wRC+ against LHP this season. Furthermore, this matchup consists of 2 of the bottom 4 bullpens in MLB in terms of combined ERA, so I'll be going with the over in this spot.\n\n_Diamondbacks vs Angels prediction: Over 8.5 (-120) available at time of publishing.

He has a history of performing well against Tyler Anderson (Angels' probable pitcher), with a .433 batting average and extra-base hits in his career against Anderson.\n2. **Corbin Carroll**: Expected to record over 1.5 total bases, including potential for extra-base hits like doubles or home runs.\n\n### **Angels:**\n\n1. **Mike Trout**: Given his impressive stats, including a .305 OBP and power-hitting capabilities (91 GP with significant home runs), Trout is likely to make an impact.\n2. **Taylor Ward**: As a primary run producer for the Angels (21 home runs and 63 RBIs), Ward could be crucial in driving in runs.\n\nThese predictions leverage current batting averages, historical performance trends, and specific matchup advantages. However, keep in mind that baseball is inherently unpredictable, and actual outcomes may vary.\n\nNext, I will search for the current runline and moneyline.",

They were powered by [Max Scherzer](https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/max-scherzer)'s first victory in nearly a year and a six-run, error-fueled fifth inning that flipped the game.\n\nNow in Game 2, Kevin Gausman looks to build on that momentum for Toronto, while Jacob Lopez hopes to steady an A's rotation still searching for answers. With Bo Bichette on a tear and Brent Rooker continuing to be a bright spot for the A's, tonight's matchup could bring another dose of late-inning drama.\n\n* * *\n\n---\n\n## **Blue Jays vs. Athletics: Game 2 Pitcher & Hitter Matchups**\n\n\n### Starting Pitchers\n\n\n#### Kevin Gausman (Blue Jays)\n\nKevin Gausman is sitting at 6-6 with a 4.13 ERA and 102 strikeouts through 18 starts. He's coming off a sharp outing against the Angels, fanning nine over 5.2 innings while allowing just two runs. Gausman still racks up swings and misses with his splitter-heavy mix and owns a 1.15 WHIP, keeping traffic manageable even on off nights.\n\n\n#### Jacob Lopez (Athletics)\n\nJacob Lopez holds a 4.26 ERA with 64 strikeouts across 13 starts. In his last appearance against the [Giants](https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/san-francisco-giants), the lefty struck out eight but was tagged for four runs in 4.1 innings. Control lapses (1.34 WHIP) and occasional home run issues (1.5 HR/9) have made it a rollercoaster season, though his strikeout stuff keeps him in games.\n\n\n### Hot Hitters\n\n\n#### Blue Jays: Bo Bichette\n\nBo Bichette slashed a ridiculous .500/.591/.833 with nine hits, three doubles, a home run, and five runs scored over his last five games. He's seeing the ball incredibly well, walking more than he's striking out (18.2% BB rate) and stacking up extra-base hits.\n\nLook for Bichette to be right in the middle of Toronto's offensive production again tonight.\n\n\n#### Athletics: Brent Rooker\n\nBrent Rooker remains the A's most reliable run producer, batting .274 with 19 homers and 51 RBIs on the season. Over his last four games, he's gone 6-for-18 (.333) with a pair of doubles, a homer, and three RBIs. While his strikeout rate's still high (44.4%), his ability to punish mistakes gives the A's some pop in the middle of their order.\n\n\n\n## Projected Lineups\n\n\n### Toronto Blue Jays (Away Team)\n\n-   3B Ernie Clement (R)\n-   RF George Springer (R)\n-   1B Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (R)\n-   SS Bo Bichette (R)\n-   DH Alejandro Kirk (R)\n-   LF Davis Schneider (R)\n-   CF Myles Straw (R)\n-   C Tyler Heineman (S)\n-   2B Leo Jimenez (R)\n-   SP: Kevin Gausman (R) - 6-6, 4.13 ERA\n\n\n### Athletics (Home Team)\n\n-   RF Lawrence Butler (L)\n-   SS Jacob Wilson (R)\n-   DH Brent Rooker (R)\n-   1B Nick Kurtz (L)\n-   3B Miguel Andujar (R)\n-   C Shea Langeliers (R)\n-   LF Tyler Soderstrom (L)\n-   2B Zack Gelof (R)\n-   CF Denzel Clarke (R)\n-   SP: Jacob Lopez (L) - 2-5, 4.26 ERA\n\n\n\n## Injury Report\n\n\n### Toronto Blue Jays\n\n-   Yimi Garcia (RP) - 15-day IL, left ankle sprain\n-   Alek Manoah (SP) - 60-day IL, recovering from elbow surgery\n-   Daulton Varsho (CF) - 10-day IL, left hamstring strain\n\n\n### Athletics\n\n-   Jacob Wilson (SS) - Day-to-day, left hand contusion\n-   Luis Urias (2B) - 10-day IL, hamstring\n-   Brady Basso (RP) - 60-day IL, shoulder\n-   Ken Waldichuk (SP) - 60-day IL, elbow\n-   Gunnar Hoglund (SP) - Out for the season, hip injury\n\n\n\n## Current Odds\n\n-   Blue Jays Runline (-1.5): -101\n-   Athletics Runline (+1.5): -121\n-   Total Runs Over 10.5: -110\n-   Total Runs Under 10.5: -110\n-   Blue Jays Moneyline: -157\n-   Athletics Moneyline: +128\n\n\n\n## Best Bets & Predictions\n\n*Score Prediction: Blue Jays 7, Athletics 4**\n\n\n### Top Bets:\n\n1.  Blue Jays Moneyline (-157) - Gausman's edge and Toronto's lineup should carry this one.\n2.  Over 10.5 Runs (-110) - Both offenses have shown firepower recently, expect a fun-filled game.\n\n*Value Parlay: Blue Jays ML + Over 10.5 runs for a strong combined play.**\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\nThank You for feedback\n\nAbout the author\n\n![Shubham Soni](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg width='100' height='100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><rect width='100' height='100' style='fill:rgb(128, 128, 128);'/></svg>)\n\nShubham Soni is a dedicated baseball journalist at Sportkeeda with a deep passion for Major League Baseball.

They were powered by [Max Scherzer](https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/max-scherzer)'s first victory in nearly a year and a six-run, error-fueled fifth inning that flipped the game.\n\nNow in Game 2, Kevin Gausman looks to build on that momentum for Toronto, while Jacob Lopez hopes to steady an A's rotation still searching for answers. With Bo Bichette on a tear and Brent Rooker continuing to be a bright spot for the A's, tonight's matchup could bring another dose of late-inning drama.\n\n* * *\n\n---\n\n## **Blue Jays vs. Athletics: Game 2 Pitcher & Hitter Matchups**\n\n\n### Starting Pitchers\n\n\n#### Kevin Gausman (Blue Jays)\n\nKevin Gausman is sitting at 6-6 with a 4.13 ERA and 102 strikeouts through 18 starts. He's coming off a sharp outing against the Angels, fanning nine over 5.2 innings while allowing just two runs. Gausman still racks up swings and misses with his splitter-heavy mix and owns a 1.15 WHIP, keeping traffic manageable even on off nights.\n\n\n#### Jacob Lopez (Athletics)\n\nJacob Lopez holds a 4.26 ERA with 64 strikeouts across 13 starts. In his last appearance against the [Giants](https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/san-francisco-giants), the lefty struck out eight but was tagged for four runs in 4.1 innings. Control lapses (1.34 WHIP) and occasional home run issues (1.5 HR/9) have made it a rollercoaster season, though his strikeout stuff keeps him in games.\n\n\n### Hot Hitters\n\n\n#### Blue Jays: Bo Bichette\n\nBo Bichette slashed a ridiculous .500/.591/.833 with nine hits, three doubles, a home run, and five runs scored over his last five games. He's seeing the ball incredibly well, walking more than he's striking out (18.2% BB rate) and stacking up extra-base hits.\n\nLook for Bichette to be right in the middle of Toronto's offensive production again tonight.\n\n\n#### Athletics: Brent Rooker\n\nBrent Rooker remains the A's most reliable run producer, batting .274 with 19 homers and 51 RBIs on the season. Over his last four games, he's gone 6-for-18 (.333) with a pair of doubles, a homer, and three RBIs. While his strikeout rate's still high (44.4%), his ability to punish mistakes gives the A's some pop in the middle of their order.\n\n\n\n## Projected Lineups\n\n\n### Toronto Blue Jays (Away Team)\n\n-   3B Ernie Clement (R)\n-   RF George Springer (R)\n-   1B Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (R)\n-   SS Bo Bichette (R)\n-   DH Alejandro Kirk (R)\n-   LF Davis Schneider (R)\n-   CF Myles Straw (R)\n-   C Tyler Heineman (S)\n-   2B Leo Jimenez (R)\n-   SP: Kevin Gausman (R) - 6-6, 4.13 ERA\n\n\n### Athletics (Home Team)\n\n-   RF Lawrence Butler (L)\n-   SS Jacob Wilson (R)\n-   DH Brent Rooker (R)\n-   1B Nick Kurtz (L)\n-   3B Miguel Andujar (R)\n-   C Shea Langeliers (R)\n-   LF Tyler Soderstrom (L)\n-   2B Zack Gelof (R)\n-   CF Denzel Clarke (R)\n-   SP: Jacob Lopez (L) - 2-5, 4.26 ERA\n\n\n\n## Injury Report\n\n\n### Toronto Blue Jays\n\n-   Yimi Garcia (RP) - 15-day IL, left ankle sprain\n-   Alek Manoah (SP) - 60-day IL, recovering from elbow surgery\n-   Daulton Varsho (CF) - 10-day IL, left hamstring strain\n\n\n### Athletics\n\n-   Jacob Wilson (SS) - Day-to-day, left hand contusion\n-   Luis Urias (2B) - 10-day IL, hamstring\n-   Brady Basso (RP) - 60-day IL, shoulder\n-   Ken Waldichuk (SP) - 60-day IL, elbow\n-   Gunnar Hoglund (SP) - Out for the season, hip injury\n\n\n\n## Current Odds\n\n-   Blue Jays Runline (-1.5): -101\n-   Athletics Runline (+1.5): -121\n-   Total Runs Over 10.5: -110\n-   Total Runs Under 10.5: -110\n-   Blue Jays Moneyline: -157\n-   Athletics Moneyline: +128\n\n\n\n## Best Bets & Predictions\n\n*Score Prediction: Blue Jays 7, Athletics 4**\n\n\n### Top Bets:\n\n1.  Blue Jays Moneyline (-157) - Gausman's edge and Toronto's lineup should carry this one.\n2.

During Tuesday's 10-1 victory over Atlanta, Jeffrey Springs delivered a solid performance on the mound for the Athletics. He pitched six innings, giving up six hits and just one earned run, while recording one walk and striking out two batters. Offensively, Brent Rooker has been the power hitter for Sacramento this season, leading the team with nineteen home runs. Tyler Soderstrom is just behind him, ranking second on the team with fifteen home runs. Rooker is also Sacramento's top producer in terms of runs batted in, driving in a team-high fifty RBIs so far this year. Jacob Wilson has set the pace in batting average, currently leading the club with an impressive .335 mark. Defensively, the Athletics have been allowing an average of 4.4 runs per game over their most recent five games. As Sacramento heads into their upcoming series against the Blue Jays, they are aiming to play spoiler. Overall, the Athletics are scoring an average of 4.2 runs per game this season.\n\nToronto enters this game on a one-game losing streak, but has won four of their last five games. In Wednesday's 2-1 defeat against the Chicago White Sox, Will Wagner stood out for Toronto, collecting two hits in four at-bats and crossing the plate for the Blue Jays' only run of the afternoon. Over the course of the season, veteran outfielder George Springer has been Toronto's main power source, leading the club with 16 home runs. Meanwhile, Addison Barger, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., and Bo Bichette are in a tie for second on the team's home run leaderboard, each having hit 12 homers thus far. Springer has also been Toronto's most productive run-producer, topping the team with 53 RBIs. When it comes to batting average, catcher Alejandro Kirk paces the lineup by hitting .306, the highest mark among Blue Jays this year. Offensively, Toronto has averaged 4.4 runs per game over their most recent five-game stretch, a solid pace that's helped them maintain a 2.5-game advantage over the Yankees in the AL East standings. As the road trip continues, the Blue Jays aim to sustain their offensive momentum in an upcoming matchup against the Athletics in Sacramento. Overall this season, Toronto is averaging 4.6 runs scored per contest.\n\n\n## Blue Jays vs Athletics Pick Analysis\n\nToronto has won all four of their games against Sacramento this season and they'll look to stay undefeated against them. On the mound for Toronto will be Max Scherzer, who currently holds a 4.76 ERA, while not yet registering a decision and has allowed just under five earned runs per nine innings on average. For Sacramento, Luis Severino will get the start. Severino has faced some struggles so far this year, posting a 2-10 record with a 5.30 ERA, showing that he's had a difficult time keeping opposing teams in check and securing victories. Final Score Prediction, Toronto Blue Jays win 5-4.\n\n\n## Betting Trends for Sacramento Athletics vs Toronto Blue Jays\n\n![](https://raketech.static.api.areyouwatchingthis.com/images/teams/80x80/7078.png)\n\nBlue Jays\n\nToronto is 22-23 on the road this season\n\nThe Blue Jays average 3.9 runs on the road\n\n![](https://raketech.static.api.areyouwatchingthis.com/images/teams/80x80/7074.png)\n\nAthletics\n\nSacramento is 17-29 at home this season\n\nThe Athletics average 4.5 runs at home\n\n\n## Our Free MLB Pick for Sacramento Athletics vs Toronto Blue Jays\n\n![Picked Team Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/pnp-staging/image/upload/v1698350828/pnp-icon-52x52.png)\n\nToronto Blue Jays -150\n\n\n**Friday July 11th MLB Parlay: Best Blue Jays vs. Athletics Parlay ...**\n![Mar 20, 2025; Dunedin, Florida, USA; Toronto Blue Jays first base Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (27) singles against the Tampa Bay Rays in the fifth inning during spring training at TD Ballpark.

Mandatory Credit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images\n\nIf it's the weekend - and it is - we're throwing a parlay party.\n\nWhen the hottest team in baseball saunters into a series with the A's, we're doubling down.\n\nToronto's [10-game winning streak ended](https://deadspin.com/mlb-roundup-white-sox-halt-blue-jays-10-game-winning-streak/), but the Blue Jays haven't lost consecutive games in three weeks. And on Friday night, the A's are serving up a lukewarm starting pitcher with their top offensive player - All-Star shortstop Jacob Wilson - a game-time decision [with a hand contusion that kept him out of the lineup](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/45705208/athletics-jacob-wilson-avoids-broken-hand-iffy-all-star-game) for two games and the previous eight innings since being hit by a pitch. We're seeing big potential for the Blue Jays to bounce back.\n\n---\n\n## Toronto Blue Jays at Oakland Athletics\n\nComing off their first loss since June 28 (2-1 to the White Sox on Wednesday), the Blue Jays have a three-game set with the A's before the All-Star break.\n\nToronto's [Max Scherzer (0-0, 4.76 ERA) will make his fifth start of the season](https://deadspin.com/sizzling-blue-jays-turn-to-max-scherzer-for-visit-to-athletics/) Friday after missing nearly three months due to a right thumb injury. The thumb was acting up during Scherzer's start against the Los Angeles Angels last Saturday. The three-time Cy Young Award winner exited after four innings and allowed two runs and five hits. The Blue Jays won 4-3 in 11 innings.\n\nScherzer is 3-1 with a 3.86 ERA in 49 innings over nine career starts against the Athletics.\n\nRight-hander Luis Severino (2-10, 5.30) hasn't been shy about complaints regarding the A's temporary home park, where he is 0-8 with a 7.04 ERA. Severino lost at home to the San Francisco Giants last Saturday, giving up five runs and five hits in 4 1/3 innings in a 7-2 setback. Overall, he has dropped four straight starts and has a 9.50 ERA during the span, serving up six homers in 18 innings.\n\nSeverino has done well against the Blue Jays, but that's because he played for the Yankees in his previous stop. He was 6-3 with a 3.97 ERA in 18 appearances (15 starts) against Toronto.\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. is 4-for-12 with a home run in his career against Severino.\n\nThe A's did swipe two of three from the Braves in their previous series, and we're no longer talking about Scherzer as a shutdown starter. There will be runs - and more runs - if hitters come through with runners on base Friday night.\n\nWe're still taking the moneyline. The Blue Jays are hot, and the A's are 18-30 at home.\n\nGiven the high WHIP rate for both starters - 1.35 for Scherzer, 1.39 for Severino - the odds are good that we'll see multiple baserunners per inning.\n\n*Parlay: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. over 1.5 total bases, Blue Jays ML and over 10.5 total runs (+675 at FanDuel)**\n\nOur Current Best Offers\n\n1\n\n[![](https://deadspin.com/casinos-logos/350x350/Underdog-ffffff.png)](https://deadspin.com/go/4327/dailyfantasysports/underdog-fantasy)\n\nUnderdog Fantasy\n\n\n### Claim your Special Pick via Code + First Time Deposit up to $250 in bonus!\n\nT&Cs apply, 18+\n\n2\n\n[![](https://deadspin.com/casinos-logos/350x350/parlayplay-ffcf10.png)](https://deadspin.com/go/6026/dailyfantasysports/parlayplay)\n\nParlayPlay\n\n\n### 100% up to $100\n\n\n3\n\n[![](https://deadspin.com/casinos-logos/350x350/ownersbox-000000.png)](https://deadspin.com/go/6275/dailyfantasysports/ownersbox)\n\nOwnersBox\n\n\n### 100% up to $500\n\n\n4\n\n[![](https://deadspin.com/casinos-logos/350x350/Fanduel-Fantasy-0070eb.png)](https://deadspin.com/go/3043/dailyfantasysports/fanduel-fantasy)\n\nFanDuel Fantasy\n\n\n### $65 value with just a $10+ deposit\n\n\n**Blue Jays vs. Athletics Prediction: Expert Picks, Odds, Stats & Best ...**\nTwo of the league's top hitters will meet Saturday when the Toronto Blue Jays (55-39) and Athletics (39-57) take to the field at 10:05 p.m. ET, live on MLB Network, NBCS-CA, and SNET.

The Thunder won the 2025 NBA Finals on Sunday night, pulling away in Game 7 for a 103-91 win over the Indiana Pacers. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander completed his historic season with 29 points, five rebounds and 12 assists to lead the way for the Thunder. SGA, the regular-season MVP, was also named Finals MVP. The Pacers struggled offensively in the second half after star guard Tyrese Haliburton [went down in the first quarter with an Achilles injury](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-torn-achilles-confirmed-for-pacers-star-who-could-miss-entire-2025-26-nba-season/). \n\nThis is the Thunder's first title since relocating to Oklahoma City in 2008. The franchise also won the 1979 championship as the Seattle SuperSonics. They won the 2025 title by being the best team all season long. The Thunder, whose average age is under 26 years old, won and NBA-best 68 games in the regular season. They went 16-7 in the playoffs and needed seven games to get by both the Pacers and the Denver Nuggets. \n\nThe Pacers, meanwhile, were massive underdogs in the series. They pushed it to seven games, but their pursuit of the first title in franchise history still came up short.\n\nGame 7 turned when Haliburton went down. The Pacers star strained his calf in Game 5 five days earlier, but he played through the injury in Game 6 and started out hot in Game 7, hitting three 3-pointers in the opening minutes. But with five minutes to go in the first quarter, Haliburton crumbled to the floor and immediately was in serious pain. Haliburton did not return and the fear is he tore his Achilles.\n\nThe Pacers stayed in the game throughout the first half and led by one point at halftime, but the Thunder blew things open in the third quarter. OKC began a 19-2 run late in the third quarter and eventually took a 22-point lead. The spurt was sparked by defense. OKC forced a total of 21 turnovers in the game. Chet Holmgren had five blocks, and Lu Dort, Alex Caruso, Cason Wallace and Jalen Williams all had multiple steals.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander did not have his most efficient night scoring, hitting just two of his 12 3-point attempts, but he dished out the 12 assists and hit 11 free throws. Gilgeous-Alexander became the first player since LeBron James in 2013 to win Finals MVP and regular-season MVP in the same season. He is the first player since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 to win MVP, Finals MVP and the NBA's scoring title in the same season.\n\nOKC also got 20 points from Williams and 18 points from Holmgren. The Pacers did not go quietly, making a late push to get the lead down to 10 points. But after a few miracles in these playoffs, they did not have a final stunning comeback in store. Bennedict Mathurin led the Pacers offensively, scoring a team-best 24 points.\n\nThis was the 20th Game 7 in Finals history, and the 15th won by the home team. The Thunder are also the first team to hit 100 points in a Finals Game 7 since 1988.\n\n---\n\nHaliburton's injury changes the game, Pacers' future. Haliburtons has not yet been confirmed, but that has not been ruled out. The Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"But he will be back\" Haliburron's injury could very well rule the Pacers out.\n\n\n**NBA Finals 2025 winners, losers: Thunder claim championship**\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals to win the title.

They have yet to hire a replacement for Tom Thibodeau. And they have a roster that made the conference finals for the first time since 2000, but had clear deficiencies that need to be addressed if they hope to seize the throne in a wide-open Eastern Conference this season.\n\nHere's where the Knicks stand entering free agency - and what they'll need to address to turn contender status into a championship reality.\n\n---\n\nThe Knicks have 10 players under contract in free agency. Karl-Anthony Towns is eligible for a two-year extension. The Knicks need to find a new coach to guide the team to a winning streak. The team needs a coach who can control the team's future. The franchise is looking for a coach to lead the team.\n\n\n**New York Knicks: Breaking News, Rumors & Highlights | Yardbarker**\n[![New York Knicks](https://www.yardbarker.com/uploads/logo/image/1276/new_york_knicks_150x150.jpg)](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/teams/new_york_knicks/65 \"New York Knicks\")\n\n[![Knicks Rookie&#39;s Fate Dependent on Summer League?](http://res.cloudinary.com/ybmedia/image/upload/c_crop,e_improve,h_365,w_912,x_0,y_42/c_fill,f_auto,h_320,q_auto,w_800/v1/m/c/4/c4c82c6fc72cf1a5a8462701e44bf4cea5c7b5f6/01jzrs9xdpg5n9e0th2p.jpg)](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/knicks_rookies_fate_dependent_on_summer_league/s1_17030_42446522)\n\n\n[\n\n![Knicks Forward Faces Important Summer League](http://res.cloudinary.com/ybmedia/image/upload/c_crop,e_improve,h_365,w_912,x_0,y_42/c_fill,f_auto,h_320,q_auto,w_800/v1/m/7/7/779d7901d6024a70a24b1d9be36b1be5c618f34f/01jzrsperxkhq59vd5cr.jpg)\n\n](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/knicks_forward_faces_important_summer_league/s1_17030_42446082)\n\n\n\n![Knicks former 1st-round pick shines in first Summer League game against Pistons](http://res.cloudinary.com/ybmedia/image/upload/c_crop,e_improve,h_800,w_2000,x_0,y_153/c_fill,f_auto,h_320,q_auto,w_800/v1/m/7/d/7d1771ec28232577bad76c974d64d839ee2acbef/NBA-Washington-Wizards-at-New-York-Knicks-24799804-scaled.jpg)\n\n](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/knicks_former_1st_round_pick_shines_in_first_summer_league_game_against_pistons/s1_15032_42445371)\n\n[![Phoenix Suns](https://www.yardbarker.com/uploads/logo/image/1351/suns.jpg)](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/teams/phoenix_suns/90 \"Phoenix Suns\")\n\n\n![The 'Most points in a game by NBA team in 2024-25' quiz](http://res.cloudinary.com/ybmedia/image/upload/c_crop,e_improve,h_634,w_1591,x_222,y_102/c_fill,f_auto,h_320,q_auto,w_800/v1/m/2/4/24a9f7cade25b2fd6dfce3652199caae8c395ae8/points-game-nba-team-2024-25-quiz.jpg)\n\n](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/the_most_points_in_a_game_by_nba_team_in_2024_25_quiz/s1__42436808)\n\n\n\n![Knicks PG One to Watch in Summer League](http://res.cloudinary.com/ybmedia/image/upload/c_crop,e_improve,h_365,w_912,x_0,y_42/c_fill,f_auto,h_320,q_auto,w_800/v1/m/c/f/cf78373133a67c76fa79717ab2386535e37bf953/01jzrs81j4dk5y1ama38.jpg)\n\n](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/knicks_pg_one_to_watch_in_summer_league/s1_17030_42445184)\n\n[![NFL](https://www.yardbarker.com/uploads/logo/image/1/NFLmedium.jpg)](https://www.yardbarker.com/nfl \"NFL\")\n\n\n![Superstar athletes whose careers ended with a whimper](http://res.cloudinary.com/ybmedia/image/upload/c_crop,h_800,w_2000,x_0,y_150/c_fill,f_auto,h_320,q_auto,w_800/v1/m/3/1/31556ea9c2d46f5ead9ca120a785091a57bebf03/superstar-athletes-whose-careers-ended-whimper.jpg)\n\n](https://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/superstar_athletes_whose_careers_ended_with_a_whimper/s1__42343297)\n\n\n\n![Knicks' 2nd-year backup guard had sloppy first impression in Summer League](http://res.cloudinary.com/ybmedia/image/upload/c_crop,e_improve,h_800,w_2000,x_0,y_152/c_fill,f_auto,h_320,q_auto,w_800/v1/m/4/8/48bf71e02b95094c0fb75795bf5f77b7123ffb2c/NBA-New-York-Knicks-at-Brooklyn-Nets-25919791-scaled.jpg)\n\n](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/knicks_2nd_year_backup_guard_had_sloppy_first_impression_in_summer_league/s1_15032_42445197)\n\n\n\n![Knicks Center Has Unique Roster Situation](http://res.cloudinary.com/ybmedia/image/upload/c_crop,e_improve,h_365,w_912,x_0,y_42/c_fill,f_auto,h_320,q_auto,w_800/v1/m/2/1/2128ff44d41c6c1582962f4c04427483152a969b/01jztzrtdkcc17sv8r6p.jpg)\n\n](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/knicks_center_has_unique_roster_situation/s1_17030_42444755)\n\n---\n\n## [Knicks Center Has Unique Roster Situation](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/knicks_center_has_unique_roster_situation/s1_17030_42444755)\n\nNew York Knicks center [Ariel Hukporti](https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/players/ariel_hukporti/911962) is entering his second Las Vegas Summer League run after being the last player chosen in the 2024 NBA Draft.

New York made a nine-figure free agent investment in a pre-All-Star **[Jalen Brunson](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brunsja01.html?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.hoopsrumors.com&utm_campaign=2025-06-20_bbr)** in 2022 that was viewed as a risk at the time. There was also a mid-season trade in 2023/24 for **[OG Anunoby](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anunoog01.html?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.hoopsrumors.com&utm_campaign=2025-06-20_bbr)** that required the team to give up a pair of former first-round picks -- one was a former No. 3 overall pick (**[RJ Barrett](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/barrerj01.html?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.hoopsrumors.com&utm_campaign=2025-06-20_bbr)**) and one had just been a Sixth Man of the Year runner-up (**[Immanuel Quickley](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/q/quickim01.html?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.hoopsrumors.com&utm_campaign=2025-06-20_bbr)**).\n\nBut the deals for Bridges and Towns represented all-in moves for the Knicks, who had stockpiled extra draft assets over the years, biding their time as they waited for the right opportunity to cash them in. The hope was that adding Bridges and Towns to a core led by Brunson and Anunoby, who both signed long-term contracts in 2024, would be enough to push the club to another level.\n\nAnd you can make a case that's exactly what happened. The regular season was up and down, as Bridges took some time to adjust to his new team and New York - facing a restrictive hard cap after completing mega-deals - struggled to find effective depth to complement its talented starting lineup. But the Knicks won more games (51) than they had a year earlier, then beat the Pistons in the first round of the playoffs before upsetting the defending champion Celtics in round two.\n\nYes, Boston lost **[Jayson Tatum](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/tatumja01.html?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.hoopsrumors.com&utm_campaign=2025-06-20_bbr)** to a season-ending Achilles injury, but the Knicks already had a 2-1 lead and were on their way to winning Game 4 when that injury occurred. Their series victory over the Celtics wasn't a fluke. Unfortunately for the Knicks, their first Eastern Conference Finals appearance in 25 years ended in disappointment, as they couldn't recover from a pair of tough home losses to open the series and fell to the Pacers in six games.\n\nDespite a pretty successful postseason run that included an unexpected second-round win, the Knicks decided a change was necessary after the conference finals loss and parted ways with head coach **Tom Thibodeau**. It was a somewhat controversial move -- while Thibodeau has faced plenty of criticism for relying too heavily on his top players and not using his bench enough, he helped change the culture in New York, where the club had posted seven consecutive sub-.500 seasons prior to his arrival.\n\nThe first order of business for the Knicks this summer is to hire Thibodeau's replacement. After that, they'll have to decide whether the roster needs another facelift or whether they'll move forward with the core they established last summer, betting on that group's ability to take another step forward under a new head coach and perhaps with some tweaks around the edges.\n\n* * *\n\n---\n\n## **The Knicks' Offseason Plan**\n\nThe Knicks' head coaching search has been unorthodox so far, to say the least. Rather than compiling the usual list of former NBA head coaches, current assistants, and perhaps some candidates from the college ranks, the Knicks sought permission to speak to at least five head coaches already employed by NBA teams.\n\n![](https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/wp-content/plugins/fv-traderumors-membership-landing/images/mlb/landing-logo.png)\n\n\n#### Unlock Subscriber-Exclusive Articles Like This One With a Trade Rumors Front Office Subscription\n\n-   Access weekly subscriber-only articles by Luke Adams\n-   Join exclusive weekly live chats with Arthur Hill\n-   Remove ads and support our writers.\n\n\n**NBA Offseason: Every deal for all 30 teamsNBA Offseason: Every deal for ...**\nKevin Durant heads to Houston via 7-team trade after spending 1/2 years in Phoenix.

It is also not a guarantee that the Knicks will want to pay Bridges what he may feel he can get on the open market.\n\nAs for Towns and Anunoby, Edwards said they're in the same proverbial boat, in that competing teams might want to trade depth pieces to New York to acquire the valuable, highly paid players.\n\n\"Anunoby and Towns are very good players, but both guys have lengthy deals - and have dealt with injuries throughout their careers. If you told me New York might try to get off of one of those, I wouldn't be totally surprised,\" Edwards wrote.\n\nIt is unknown if the Knicks will overhaul their roster in either a minor or major way, and it is also anyone's guess when and who New York hires as head coach.

Free agency, though, isn't what it used to be. The new trend in the league is for the star players to sign extensions with their current teams before they ever get to free agency, and then if they want to move they just demand a trade to a preferred destination with their financials secured.\n\nTeams have recognized this trend, and are no longer hoarding cap space to plan for free agents that never become available. As such, the [Brooklyn Nets](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/BKN/brooklyn-nets/) are the only team this summer with max cap space, so you shouldn't be expecting major free agency news.
