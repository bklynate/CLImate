The team is one of the worst teams in the league.\n\n\n**MLB Gameday: Mets at Pirates, Probable Pitchers, Lineups, and more**\nGlobe iconLogin iconRecap iconSearch iconTickets icon\n\nClose icon\n\n\n**Pittsburgh Pirates Name Probable Starting Pitchers vs. Mets**\nPITTSBURGH - The Pittsburgh Pirates host the New York Mets at PNC Park for a weekend series, with a change to their starting rotation.\n\nRight-handed pitcher Mitch Keller starts the series opener on June 27, marking his 17th start of the season for the Pirates. Keller has a 1-10 record, with a 4.02 ERA over 94.0 innings pitched, 73 strikeouts to 24 walks, a .249 opposing batting average and a 1.22 WHIP.\n\nHe has 11 quality starts on the season, tied for the seventh most in the MLB, despite his record, as he's received poor run support all campaign. Keller [excelled](https://www.si.com/mlb/pirates/news/pittsburgh-pirates-falter-plate-close-loss-new-york-mets) in his previous start vs. the Mets back at Citi Field on May 13, with just two runs allowed over seven innings, while posting a season-high eight strikeouts in the 2-1 defeat.\n\nHe made his most recent start vs. the Texas Rangers at PNC Park on June 21, where he allowed three runs, two earned, with five strikeouts over 99 pitches in the 3-2 [loss](https://www.si.com/mlb/pirates/news/pittsburgh-pirates-falter-offensively-drop-close-loss-texas-rangers).\n\nKeller is looking for his first win since March 28 vs. the Miami Marlins at loanDepot Park and his first win at PNC Park since he beat the Mets on July 8, 2024.\n\nLeft-handed pitcher Bailey Falter will start the second game of the series on June 28, also marking his 17th start of the season. Falter has pitched well in 2025, with a 6-3 record over 16 starts, a 3.53 ERA over 85.1 innings pitched, 51 strikeouts to 31 walks, a .230 opposing batting average and a 1.18 WHIP.\n\nHe faced the Mets in the 4-0 [victory](https://www.si.com/mlb/pirates/news/pittsburgh-pirates-shutout-mets-avoid-series-sweep) on May 14, but didn't get the win, throwing 78 pitches over 3.2 innings before the Pirates bullpen came in and shut the home team down.\n\nFalter allowed three earned runs over 5.1 innings in his most recent start vs. the Rangers on June 22, with six hits and five walks allowed to one strikeout, but the Pirates offense came through with eight runs, giving him his sixth victory of the season.\n\nRookie right-handed pitcher Mike Burrows gets the start for the Pirates in the series finale on June 29. Burrows pitched 2.1 innings in relief vs. the Milwaukee Brewers at American Family Field, coming in for star right-handed pitcher Paul Skenes in the 4-2 loss. Burrows allowed just one walk and posted a strikeout in his first bullpen appearance of the season.\n\nHe last started vs. the Rangers on June 20, where he struggled, allowing four runs over 4.2 innings in the 6-2 loss.\n\nA doubleheader vs. the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park on June 19 moved the starting rotation around for the last series with the Brewers.\n\nBoth left-handed pitcher Andrew Heaney and Skenes started that day, so they moved their starts back a day, and Heaney didn't have only three days of rest between starts.\n\nThe Pirates went with a bullpen game on June 23, with rookie right-handed pitcher [Braxton Ashcraft](https://www.si.com/mlb/pirates/news/pittsburgh-pirates-braxton-ashcraft-excels-first-career-start) starting, which moved Burrows back from the series finale, right after Skenes, to the series finale vs. the Mets.\n\n[_Make sure to visit Pirates OnSI for the latest news, updates, interviews and insight on the Pittsburgh Pirates_](https://www.si.com/mlb/pirates)\n\n\n**Starting Line-up, Game Preview: Mets @ Pirates - Duda In LF**\nDillon Gee looks to become the first Mets rookie pitcher to open a season 7-0, and Lucas Duda will play left field and bat sixth tonight as the Mets take on the Pirates in Pittsburgh. Here is the rest of the line-up and preview.\n\n*Starting Line-up**\n\nJose Reyes, ss\nJustin Turner, 3b\nCarlos Beltran, rf\nDaniel Murphy, 1b\nAngel Pagan, cf\nLucas Duda, lf\nJosh Thole, c\nRuben Tejada, 2b\nDillon Gee, rhp\n\n*Game Preview**\n\nThe Mets and the Pirates start a four game series tonight in Pittsburgh as the Mets look to continue what they started in Milwaukee and bring it down to Pittsburgh. The Mets are coming off of a series win that could have easily been a sweep where the team is playing with a lot of grit and a lot of fight right now. Tonight, the rookie wonder Gee will get a start as he goes up against a success story this year in Charlie Morton.\n\nDillon Gee is 6-0 this season with a 3.33 ERA. His last start was brilliant as he tossed 7 scoreless frames against the Braves and his start before that was also good and it was against the Pirates as he pitched 7 innings allowing 3 earned runs. While his starts on the whole are not all lights out, his starts have been competitive, the Mets have had a chance to win with him on the mound. The Bucs have the following numbers against Dillon:\n\nCedeno 2-6\n\nJones 2-6\n\nMcCutchen 0-6\n\nTabata 1-6, 2B\n\nThe Mets will get to see Morton again. So far this season he is having an incredible bounce back year with his 2.52 ERA (compared to 7.57 from a year ago). In his last start he picked up the win in Philly with a 6 inning, 2 ER performance. Against the Mets he was a hard luck loser last time out as he allowed 3 runs, only one earned in 6 innings of work. However don't feel too bad because the Mets tagged him for 11 hits during those 6 innings. The Amazin's have the following numbers on Morton:\n\nPagan 5-6\n\nTejada 3-3\n\nThole 1-5\n\nBeltran 1-3\n\nMurphy 2-4\n\nLet's Go Mets!\n\n[Check 213 Miles From Shea!](https://213milesfromshea.metsblog.com/)\n\n\n**MLB Starting Lineups Today | New York Mets**\n---\n\n## Starting Lineups\n\nNew York Mets\n\narrow-downArrow Down icon\n\nAll Times Eastern.

Manager Carlos Mendoza said following the game that Canning will undergo testing but that the team believes the injury is to his Achilles.\n\nCanning likely will become the third Mets starter to hit the injured list this month. Kodai Senga is sidelined with a strained right hamstring while Tylor Megill has a right elbow sprain.\n\nPeterson, who has allowed three runs or less in 13 of his 15 starts this season, and right-hander Clay Holmes are the only remaining healthy members of the Mets' season-opening rotation. But Holmes, who transitioned to starting after spending most of his first seven seasons as a late-inning reliever, already has thrown a career-high 88 innings.\n\n\"Nobody's going to feel sorry for us,\" Mendoza said. \"We'll find a way. We'll find a way. Guys will step up. Our mentality is, 'What do we need to do today?' Pretty confident in the guys that we've got in that room.\"\n\nThe Pirates, meanwhile, were off Thursday, one day after losing 4-2 to the host Milwaukee Brewers in the rubber match of a three-game series.\n\nFriday will be another chance to find out if Pittsburgh interim manager Don Kelly's discipline of center fielder Oneil Cruz earlier this week had the desired effect. Cruz was pulled from Tuesday's game after failing to run out a double-play grounder in the eighth inning.\n\nCruz also showed a lack of urgency in a 6-2 loss to the Texas Rangers last Friday after he didn't chase the ball following a first-inning single by Sam Haggerty skipped under his glove. Right fielder Adam Frazier chased the ball down, but Josh Smith scored all the way from first while Haggerty ended up at third.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cruz failed to make a sliding catch of Eric Haase's third-inning RBI bloop double, but he immediately got back up and retrieved the ball.\n\n\"I think he understood from last week against Texas, and made it clear (Tuesday), that that's not going to be tolerated,\" Kelly said. \"We need more. Not more hits, not more home runs -- that will come with the work -- but the effort and the way we go about it. And I think he heard it.\"\n\nPeterson took the defeat on Sunday after he allowed a season-high five runs over four innings as the Mets fell to the Philadelphia Phillies 7-1. He is 0-0 with a 3.31 ERA in four career games (three starts) against the Pirates.\n\nKeller took the loss last Saturday after giving up three runs (two earned) over 5 2/3 innings as the Pirates were edged by the Rangers 3-2. He is 3-2 with a 2.12 ERA in five career starts against the Mets.\n\n\\--Field Level Media\n\nCopyright 2025 STATS LLC and Field Level Media.

Tonight, the New York Mets are set to face off against the Pittsburgh Pirates in what promises to be an intriguing matchup for fans and analysts alike.\n\nLet's start with the pitching duel. The Mets will send David Peterson to the mound. With a solid record of 5-3 and an ERA hovering around 3.3, he has demonstrated his ability to keep hitters at bay effectively this season. His strikeout capability is impressive as well; averaging over eight strikeouts per nine innings speaks volumes about his capacity to dominate opposing batters. On the flip side, Mitch Keller will be toeing the rubber for Pittsburgh. Unfortunately for him and Pirates fans, his win-loss record of 1-10 reflects a season riddled with challenges on the mound despite having an ERA of around 4.0 that shows he isn't entirely ineffective.\n\nWhen analyzing their offensive performance this season, it's clear why oddsmakers opened up with Mets as -175 favorites. The Mets have averaged just over four runs per game and boast nearly eight hits each outing-significantly better than Pittsburgh's offense, which has struggled mightily with only about three runs per game and a batting average lingering around .225. The Mets' ability to get on base (over 72% slugging) compared to Pittsburgh's numbers signals trouble for Keller tonight.\n\nLooking back through my coaching years, I've often emphasized how critical it is for pitchers to find their rhythm early in games. If Keller can't locate his pitches or fall behind in counts against aggressive hitters from New York-who have proven they can capitalize on mistakes-we may witness another tough night for him on home soil.\n\nThe recent trends also tell us quite a story: while New York has been gaining some momentum winning four out of its last six games ATS (against the spread), Pittsburgh finds itself struggling with only three wins out of their last eleven games overall. This kind of disparity usually leads me to favor teams like New York who seem poised and prepared.\n\nDefensively speaking, both teams have had ups and downs this season; however, what stands out is how effective Peterson has been when he takes control of the game early versus Keller's propensity to surrender those early runs which could shift momentum quickly in favor of New York.\n\nAll indicators point towards expecting more action tonight than usual given both teams' recent trends-in particular how consistently high-scoring games have been lately with Pittsburgh going OVER in seven of their last nine outings combined with New York's recent performance spikes at plate activity.\n\nMy prediction? Expect the Mets to pull off a victory here against an underperforming Pirates squad while scoring over that total line set at 8.5 runs should push towards being reachable too due mainly to offensive firepower from both sides-a perfect recipe for fireworks at PNC Park tonight!\n\n\n**Mets vs. Pirates odds, tips and betting trends**\n![logo](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/sitelogos/m-oc.svg)\n\nusatoday.com wants to ensure the best experience for all of our readers, so we built our site to take advantage of the latest technology, making it faster and easier to use.\n\nUnfortunately, your browser is not supported.

He also piled up the strikeouts and he has the ideal matchup to do so again in Boston. Two more pitchers I will be targeting today are [Michael King](https://www.actionnetwork.com/mlb/players/michael-king-80915-rp) and David Peterson.\n\nLet's dive into my three **MLB player props** and picks for Thursday, August 29.\n\n---\n\nMLB player prop bets are becoming more popular with bettors. The bets focus on player statistics, rather than just game outcomes. The Mets vs. Diamondbacks matchup is one of the most important bets to bettor. The Yankees vs. Mets game is scheduled to be played on Thursday.\n\n\n**Best MLB player props for Friday: Peterson schools D-Backs - Pickswise**\nUpdated: 14:32 PM ET May 07, 2021\n\nThe cornerstone of any great Friday is MLB player props. A typical Friday for me starts with checking the wind at Wrigley and then diving into the MLB night slate. With all the night games, bettors shouldn't feel rushed as there is plenty of time to vet the slate properly. If we want to throw something at the Cubs game we can but if not that's fine too. I already found two player props for tonight's games that feel very winnable. Let's go!\n\nDon't forget to [check what our MLB analysts have backed](https://www.pickswise.com/sports/mlb/) with side and total picks for all 15 games today/tonight. As always, bets can be added to the card so why not [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sloprules) in case we get some last second action? It makes sense.\n\n---\n\n## David Peterson Over 5.5 Strikeouts (+120)\n\n_Line available at publishing at FanDuel_\n\nDavid Peterson isn't exactly a household name but the leftie is nice. He doesn't really have \"wow\" stuff but it's good enough that he's posted a 29% strikeout rate this season. Tonight, he gets to show off against an Arizona Diamondbacks team that strikes out like it's their job.\n\nIn the last seven days, the Diamondbacks are in the bottom half of MLB in strikeouts despite only playing in five games. They are fresh off of being swept by the Miami Marlins and have now lost four of their last five games. In the Marlins series, both starters that went at least five innings struck out at least six D-Backs.\n\nArizona's lineup is full of strikeout artists as Josh VanMeter, Josh Rojas, Nick Ahmed, Christian Walker and Zac Gallen are all sporting 23% or higher strikeout rates on the season. Carson Kelly is at 30% over the last week as well if we needed another target.\n\nPeterson has proven he can handle \"strikeout teams' as he has reached at least eight in his last two starts against the Philadelphia Phillies. If he can go at least five innings tonight, Peterson should find a way to strikeout six D-Backs. This is one of my favorite player props tonight.\n\nBe sure to check out our full game preview for [Arizona Diamondbacks vs. New York Mets](https://www.pickswise.com/mlb/predictions/arizona-diamondbacks-vs-new-york-mets-predictions/).\n\n\n## Trevor Rogers Over 7.5 Strikeouts (+120)\n\n_Line available at publishing at Fanduel_\n\n![Trevor Rogers player props](https://www.pickswise.com/wp-content/offload/uploads/2021/05/07113522/USATSI_16003539-min-1024x748.jpg)\n\n© Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDraftKings did the thing where they went 6.5 (-135) on Rogers and FanDuel went 7.5 (+120) so I am going with FanDuel here. Obviously 6.5 is easier but I like the +120 we're getting for 7.5. Rogers warrants the love as he has a 33% strikeout rate on the season.\n\nHe has not hit this number in two straight starts but he hasn't been far off either. In his last start against the Nationals, he only fanned six but that was the Nationals. Only one team in MLB has struck out less than they have this season (Mets).\n\nThe Brewers are a different animal all together. Over the last seven days, only two teams in MLB have struck out more than they have. Rogers pitched against them in Milwaukee on April 26th and was able to get seven of them on strikes in only six innings.\n\nRogers could possibly get double digit Ks tonight with the right lineup. Kolten Wong, Jacob Nottingham, Jackie Bradley Jr and Luis Urias all have K-rates higher than 23% in the last week. Nottingham is the main one we want to see in the lineup as he is at 62.5% this season. This is another one of my favorite player props tonight.\n\nBe sure to check out our full game preview for [Milwaukee Brewers vs Miami Marlins](https://www.pickswise.com/mlb/predictions/milwaukee-brewers-vs-miami-marlins-predictions/).\n\n_Pickswise is the home of free [**MLB picks and predictions**](https://www.pickswise.com/sports/mlb/)__.

While they aren't always as fun as [home run props](https://props.com/best-hr-props-today/) or [NRFI prop bets](https://props.com/nrfi/), MLB strikeout props usually have more predictive value.\n\nBecause of that, we can dig into the analytics to hunt for betting value.

Today's slate features a sharp mix of elite strikeout rates and favorable lineup splits, with arms like [Dylan Cease](https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/dylan-cease), Logan Gilbert and David Peterson set to take the mound.\n\nWe've also got a bold play on Tomoyuki Sugano, whose form lately makes him a sneaky strikeout option against Tampa Bay.\n\nLet's break down the top five pitcher strikeout prop bets for June 27, with strikeout trends, game logs and matchup data backing every pick.\n\n*Note:** **_Odds are set by DraftKings Sportsbook and are subject to change. No outcome can be guaranteed when betting on sports._**\n\n* * *\n\n---\n\n### **Today's Top Five MLB Pitchers Strikeouts Prop Bets**\n\n\n### #5. Dylan Cease - Over 6.5 Ks (-150)\n\n![Dylan Cease could pile up double-digit K&rsquo;s if he&rsquo;s locked in (Credits: IMAGN)](https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/06/26506766-1751017269.jpeg?w=640)\n\nDylan Cease could pile up double-digit K's if he's locked in (Credits: IMAGN)\n\nDylan Cease continues to flash elite strikeout ability with a strong 11.2 K/9 across 87.1 innings this season. He's topped this 6.5 line in four of his last six outings, including 11 and 9 strikeout performances in that stretch.\n\nThe Reds' lineup has been prone to whiffs, and with Cease's swing-and-miss stuff working, this number feels well within reach if he's efficient early.\n\n\n\n### #4. Sonny Gray - Over 5.5 Ks (-150)\n\n![Sonny Gray looks poised to dominate on the mound today (Credits: IMAGN)](https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/06/26342741-1751017351.jpeg?w=640)\n\nSonny Gray looks poised to dominate on the mound today (Credits: IMAGN)\n\n[Sonny Gray](https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/sonny-gray)'s strikeout stuff has stayed sharp this season, carrying a 9.6 K/9 with 90 punchouts across 84.2 innings. He's hit at least six strikeouts in three of his last five starts, with double-digit performances showing his ceiling remains intact.\n\nFacing a [Guardians](https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/cleveland-guardians) lineup with modest plate discipline, Gray's mix of breaking pitches and command makes this over 5.5 line a fair, playable number for today's prop market.\n\n\n\n### #3. Logan Gilbert - Over 6.5 Ks (-130)\n\n![Logan Gilbert could be unhittable when he finds his groove (Credits: IMAGN)](https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/06/26016075-1751017385.jpeg?w=640)\n\nLogan Gilbert could be unhittable when he finds his groove (Credits: IMAGN)\n\nLogan Gilbert has quietly been one of the most efficient strikeout arms this season, carrying a 13.4 K/9 rate while limiting walks to just 1.6 per nine innings. His fastball velocity and sharp breaking stuff have consistently generated whiffs, and with 60 strikeouts in just 40.1 innings, the swing-and-miss stuff is undeniable.\n\nFacing a [Rangers](https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/texas-rangers) lineup that ranks among the league's most strikeout-prone against right-handers over the past two weeks, Gilbert is well-positioned to clear this 6.5 mark in what could be another high-volume outing.\n\n\n\n### #2. David Peterson - Over 4.5 Ks (-160) - Safest Pick of the Day\n\n![David Peterson is the most reliable prop to cash in (Credits: IMAGN)](https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/06/26478735-1751017427.jpeg?w=640)\n\nDavid Peterson is the most reliable prop to cash in (Credits: IMAGN)\n\nDavid Peterson continues to deliver reliable mid-rotation stability for the [Mets](https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/new-york-mets), posting a 2.98 ERA with a 7.7 K/9 this season. He's cleared 4.5 strikeouts in four of his last six outings, including totals of 6, 6, 5, and 7 Ks.\n\nAgainst a Pirates lineup that's been prone to strikeouts versus left-handed pitching, this prop holds solid value as one of the safer strikeout spots on today's board.\n\n\n\n### #1. Tomoyuki Sugano - Over 3.5 Ks (+110) - Bold prediction of the day\n\n![Tomoyuki Sugano is a bold call that could defy the odds. (Credits: IMAGN)](https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/06/26493983-1751017465.jpeg?w=640)\n\nTomoyuki Sugano is a bold call that could defy the odds. (Credits: IMAGN)\n\nTomoyuki Sugano isn't your prototypical strikeout machine, but the veteran righty has quietly carved out solid K outings lately. With a crisp 3.55 ERA and a crafty arsenal built around his splitter and cutter, Sugano has cleared this modest 3.5 line in three of his last five starts, logging 5, 4, and 4 Ks in that stretch.\n\nAgainst the Rays lineup, at plus money, this is a sharp value play for bettors hunting an under-the-radar strikeout prop with realistic upside.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\nThank You for feedback\n\nAbout the author\n\n![Shubham Soni](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg width='100' height='100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><rect width='100' height='100' style='fill:rgb(128, 128, 128);'/></svg>)\n\nShubham Soni is a dedicated baseball journalist at Sportkeeda with a deep passion for Major League Baseball.

In this article, we're going to focus on player props. I have three locked in, including an aggressive play on Elly De La Cruz against the Cardinals.\n\n---\n\n### Cardinals vs. Reds Prop Bet\n\nMiles Mikolas is set to get the start for the St. Louis Cardinals tonight and he's struggled to start the season, allowing 10.3 hits per nine innings. On top of that, the Cardinals' bullpen has allowed opposing teams to bat .249 against them, which ranks 23rd in the Majors.\n\nTo try to take advantage of that, I'm going to back Elly De La Cruz to record at least two hits tonight at 2-1 odds. He has recorded 2+ hits in three of his last four games and he has a batting average of .279 against right-handed pitchers this season.\n\n[_**Pick: Elly De La Cruz OVER 1.5 Hits (+200)**_](https://bit.ly/3Q4vm8c)\n\n\n### Diamondbacks vs. Mets Prop Bet\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks have the lowest strikeout total against left-handed pitchers this season, striking out on just 14.2% of plate appearances. That's the best mark against lefties in the Majors by a staggering 3.5%.\n\nTonight, they face a lefty starter in David Peterson, who has 5+ strikeouts in just three of his five starts this season. I think this is a great spot to bet the UNDER on his strikeout total.\n\n[_**Pick: David Peterson UNDER 4.5 Strikeouts (-105)**_](https://bit.ly/4hmNc2h)\n\n\n### Angels vs. Mariners Prop Bet\n\nThe Seattle Mariners have done a great job of drawing walks this season, getting on on 11.4% of their plate appearances, the best mark in the Majors by 0.3%. Tonight, they will face Jack Kochanowicz of the Angels who has walked 3+ batters in two of his five starts this season.\n\nWe only need him to give up two walks to cash this bet tonight.\n\n[_**Pick: Jack Kochanowicz OVER 1.5 Walks Allowed (-109)**_](https://bit.ly/42IKuzA)\n\nCreate a new FanDuel Sportsbook account, and you can get [**$250 in bonus bets if you win your first $5 wager**.](https://bit.ly/3Q4vm8c) Download the FanDuel app and deposit a minimum of $5 to claim your new-user bonus today.\n\n_**Odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.**_\n\n_**If you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.**_\n\nYou can check out all of [Iain's bets here](https://betstamp.app/u/iainmacbets)!\n\n\n**Best MLB Prop Bets Today (Predictions Trea Turner, David Peterson ...**\nIt's a new week which means we have a brand new slate of MLB games to watch and bet on.\n\nIf you want to dip your toe into the player prop world, you've come to the right place.

His batting average improves from .291 against right-handed pitchers to .356 against left-handed pitchers. His average also improves from .262 on the road to .366 at home. Tonight, he and the Phillies will face a lefty on their home field when Matthew Liberatore takes the mound to take on the Cardinals.\n\n_**Pick:**_ [_**Trea Turner OVER 1.5 Total Bases (-115)**_](https://bit.ly/4hzI9LA)\n\n\n### Pirates vs. Mets Prop Bet\n\nThe Pirates have struggled against left-handed pitchers this season. They have the third-highest strikeout rate when facing lefties at 26.3%. Tonight, they'll take on a lefty starter in David Peterson of the Mets, who has reached six strikeouts in two of his last four starts. I'll bet on him to reach six strikeouts again tonight.\n\n_**Pick:**_ [_**David Peterson OVER 5.5 Strikeouts (-118)**_](https://bit.ly/3Q4vm8c)\n\n\n### Yankees vs. Mariners Prop Bet\n\nThe Yankees have shown fantastic plate discipline of late. Over the past 30 days, the Yankees have the second-highest walk rate at 10.6%. Tonight, they'll face a rookie arm in Emerson Hancock, who has walked two batters in three of his five starts this season.

He allows just 0.81 home runs per nine innings while he strikes out 8.84 batters in the same span.\n\nHe's been specifically dominant in division play, averaging 7.0 Ks in five games against fellow AL East teams, four of which came against powerhouse lineups in the [Baltimore Orioles](https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/teams/mlb/baltimore-orioles/odds) and [New York Yankees](https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/teams/mlb/new-york-yankees/odds).\n\nKikuchi looks primed to meet or exceed this average in his first meeting of the season with Boston.\n\nThe Red Sox have perfected their post-at-bat strut to the dugout against lefties. They strike out at an eye-popping 28.7% rate against this handedness, which leads the league by a significant margin. Only three other teams possess a 25.0% K% or higher versus left-handed pitchers.\n\nKikuchi is also known to pitch further into the game when throwing at home. He's averaging 6.15 IP at Rogers Centre but just 4.86 IP on the road.\n\nHe has a pretty high ceiling against this strikeout-prone team and has punched out at least nine batters on a trio of occasions, so I'd consider targeting **Kikuchi 8+ Strikeouts (+162)**, too.\n\n\n### [Randy Vasquez Under 3.5 Strikeouts (+104)](https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/baseball/mlb/san-diego-padres-@-philadelphia-phillies-33352409?tab=pitcher-props)\n\nThe [Philadelphia Phillies](https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/teams/mlb/philadelphia-phillies/odds) (NL-best 47-24 record) are one of the hottest teams in baseball, so it's easy to question [Randy Vasquez](https://www.numberfire.com/mlb/players/randy-vasquez)'s fate on the mound tonight.\n\nPhiladelphia is generating a .321 OBP (5th), .401 SLG (10th), 105 wRC+ (tied for 7th), and 9.2% walk rate (6th) versus right-handed pitchers.\n\nThey're striking out at a modest 20.8% K% (seventh-lowest in MLB) against this handedness and have been even more K-resistant on their home turf.\n\nVasquez has been underwhelming for the [San Diego Padres](https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/teams/mlb/san-diego-padres/odds). He comes in with a 4.93 ERA and 1.51 WHIP and allows 1.88 home runs per nine innings. Not only is he at risk of getting rocked, but he also is producing a mere 15.4% K%.\n\nVasquez has recorded under 3.5 strikeouts in five out of eight starts this season. In his career, he has recorded under 3.5 strikeouts in 9 out of 13 starts. The bar on his strikeout prop is low, but it's low for a reason, and this matchup seems to be grounds for siding with the plus-money odds.\n\n\n### [David Peterson Under 4.5 Strikeouts (-122)](https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/baseball/mlb/new-york-mets-@-texas-rangers-33352417?tab=pitcher-props)\n\n[David Peterson](https://www.numberfire.com/mlb/players/david-peterson) might not have 5 Ks in him for tonight's matchup against the [Texas Rangers](https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/teams/mlb/texas-rangers/odds).\n\nThrough three starts, Peterson is struggling with a 5.65 xERA, 4.88 xFIP, and 4.88 SIERA. He still has much to improve upon after producing a 5.03 ERA and 4.96 xERA in the 2023 season.\n\nHe's managed just six strikeouts in 16 2/3 innings, good for an unappealing 8.1% K%. This rate will undoubtedly show regression with a longer sample, but a 7.6% swinging strike rate is room for concern.\n\nPeterson has been known to force opponents into ground balls, with a 54.6% GB% last season and a 57.4% GB% in this campaign. The Rangers are grounding out at a 45.3% rate versus lefties (seventh-highest), so Peterson's easy outs could be by virtue of a grounder.\n\nTexas' 22.1% K% against left-handed pitchers (13th) isn't gaudy, and they are striking out at just a 20.2% clip (sixth-lowest) on their home field.\n\nAll customers get a [30% Profit Boost](https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/8/232838;8282854;369307;211;0/?ft_width=1&ft_height=1&gdpr=$%7BGDPR%7D&gdpr_consent=$%7BGDPR_CONSENT_78%7D&us_privacy=$%7BUS_PRIVACY%7D&url=38682434) to use on a 3+ leg Same Game Parlay for any MLB game happening June 17th!

Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Dustin May (85) throws during the third inning.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers (51-31) begin a three-game weekend series with the Kansas City Royals (38-43) on Friday night at Kauffman Stadium.\n\nThe books are expecting runs, setting the total at 9.5. Read why I'm not so bullish on offense with my Dodgers vs. Royals predictions and [MLB picks](https://www.covers.com/picks/mlb) for Friday, June 27.\n\n---\n\n## Dodgers vs Royals prediction\n\n*My Dodgers vs Royals best bet**: Under 9.5 ([\\-114 at DraftKings](https://www.draftkings.com/))\n\n\n### ⚾ Pick Analysis\n\nIt'll be a warm day at Kauffman Stadium, with temperatures in the upper 80's and winds of 5 to 6 mph blowing out to left field. Naturally, the books are expecting runs in bunches and have set the total up at 9.5.\n\nNot so fast, my friend.\n\nAnticipating offense in a [Kansas City Royals](https://www.covers.com/sport/baseball/mlb/teams/main/kansas-city-royals/odds) game is usually a foolhardy idea. They're on a tremendous run to the Under, going below the total in 46 of their last 73 games.\n\nPart of the reason they enter this series on a five-game losing streak is that the lineup has been lost at the plate, scoring just four total runs in that span. All five games have gone Under the total.\n\n[Dustin May](https://www.covers.com/sport/baseball/mlb/players/124415/dustin-may) gets the nod for the [Los Angeles Dodgers](https://www.covers.com/sport/baseball/mlb/teams/main/los-angeles-dodgers/odds). He has to be licking his chops against a Kansas City lineup ranking dead last in wRC+ (52) and wOBA (.250) against right-handed pitching in the last 15 days.\n\nHis pitching counterpart will be [Noah Cameron](https://www.covers.com/sport/baseball/mlb/players/352248/noah-cameron). The rookie sensation has allowed one earned run or fewer in six of his eight starts in the Big Leagues en route to a 2.08 ERA.\n\nWhile he's bound to regress due to an unsustainable .205 BABIP and 86.6% left-on-base percentage, the southpaw likely won't fall off a cliff considering his impressive 3.30 xERA and .229 xBA. The Central Arkansas product has induced soft contact with a 5.1% barrel rate that ranks in the 89th percentile.\n\nThe Dodgers are a tough test, but they're generally not as fearsome against left-handers. They have an 11-11 record against lefty starters, which is a far cry from their 40-20 record against righties.\n\nBehind Cameron is a solid Kansas City bullpen that has a 3.05 ERA across the last 15 days, and it will be well-rested with only one reliever having thrown over 30 pitches in the last three days.\n\n\n## Dodgers vs Royals same-game parlay (SGP)\n\n[![bet365 Logo](https://images.covers.com/betting/sportsbooks/2/bet365.png)](https://www.covers.com/betting/sportsbookredirect?vertical=betting&location=editorial&slug=bet365)\n\nDodgers First Five Innings moneyline\n\nDustin May 4+ strikeouts\n\nUnder 9.5\n\n\n### **🚀** **SGP Analysis** \n\nThe Royals have hit the First Five Innings moneyline in just four of their last 24 home games, resulting in an auto-fade, especially against a team as good as the Dodgers, who have won six of their last seven away games.\n\nThe Royals are in the midst of a slump, losing five consecutive games to fall 3.5 games back of the last AL Wild Card spot. The Dodgers, meanwhile, have won 10 of their last 12.\n\nDustin May has recorded 4+ strikeouts in three of his last five outings and stands to benefit from Kansas City's prolonged drought at the dish against right-handers.\n\n\n## Dodgers vs Royals odds\n\n\n### Dodgers vs Royals live odds\n\n\n### Dodgers vs Royals opening odds\n\n-   **Moneyline**: Los Angeles -158 | Kansas City +129\n-   **Run line**: Los Angeles -1.5 (+104) | Kansas City +1.5 (-126)\n-   **Over/Under**: Over 9.5 (-113) | Under 9.5 (-108)\n\n\n## Dodgers vs Royals trend\n\nKansas City has hit the Under in five straight games.

It's the first time the Royals are in Los Angeles since 2017.\n\nBoth teams enter the weekend in playoff position. The Dodgers lead the National League West, while the Royals are second in the American League Central but firmly in second wild card position. At 40-30, this is the best record Kansas City has ever had heading into a matchup with the Dodgers. Previously, the Royals' most games over .500 at the start of a Dodgers series was four games over in 2017, but then they got swept by the Dodgers.\n\nContention is rare air for the Royals, who haven't made the playoffs since winning the [World Series](https://www.sbnation.com/world-series) in 2015 and last finished even .500 eight years ago. From 2018-2023, [the Royals had the worst record in baseball](https://stathead.com/tiny/NsR3I) (338-532, .389), including three 100-loss seasons. They lost 106 games _last year_.\n\nThis season, Kansas City is actually good, having outscored their opponents by 60 runs, the eighth-best run differential in baseball. A big reason for the Royals success in 2024 is thanks to the three pitchers starting this weekend at Dodger Stadium.\n\n---\n\n### Dodgers-Royals schedule\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n      \"Day_2\": \"Fri\",\n      \"Time_2\": \"7:10p\",\n      \"Pitchers_2\": \"Stone v.

Brady Singer was the Royals' first-round pick in 2018 and now has a 3.30 ERA and 4.60 xERA through 13 starts in his fifth major league season.\n\nThe Dodgers are also sending their best three starting pitchers to the mound this weekend. Yoshinobu Yamamoto [is getting two extra days of rest](https://www.truebluela.com/2024/6/12/24177361/dodgers-rotation-yoshinobu-yamamoto-extra-rest) after seven scoreless innings at Yankee Stadium, and will now start Saturday against Kansas City. [Gavin Stone starts Friday's opener](https://www.sbnation.com/e/23942171), having allowed 10 runs in his last eight starts.\n\nTyler Glasnow lost his last two starts, the first by lack of run support and the second by grooving a pitch to Trent Grisham. But on the season he's been quite good with a 3.24 ERA and 2.58 xERA, and leads the majors with 116 strikeouts. Glasnow starts the series finale on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Dodgers and Royals have both made the postseason in the same year six times - 1977, 1978, 1981, 1985, 2014, and 2015. In each of those six seasons, one of them has reached the World Series.\n\n\n**Royals head into matchup against the Dodgers on losing streak**\nError: Unable to extract content.\n\n\n**Dodgers vs. Royals Prediction, Odds & Best Bets: Friday, June 27**\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers (51-31) are -160 betting favorites across our [best sports betting sites](https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-sites/) to win the first game of a weekend series with the Kansas City Royals (38-43), but our **Dodgers vs. Royals prediction, odds, and best bets** expect the home underdogs to surprise behind a rookie lefty on the mound.\n\n-   **Dodgers vs. Royals prediction: Royals +1.5 (-120 via [bet365](https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-sites/bet365/)) ⭐⭐⭐⭐**\n-   **Over/Under prediction: Under 9.5 (-104 via [FanDuel](https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-sites/fanduel/)) ⭐⭐⭐**\n-   **Best player prop pick: Noah Cameron Under 2.5 earned runs allowed (+130 via [DraftKings](https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-sites/draftkings/)) ⭐⭐⭐⭐**\n\n---\n\n## ⚾ Dodgers vs. Royals predictions & odds\n\n*🔎 Our NEW [MLB player prop odds tool](https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/props/mlb/) can help you find the best [MLB odds](https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/mlb-baseball/) to make your best [MLB picks](https://www.sportsbookreview.com/picks/mlb/).**\n\n\n### 📊 Live Dodgers vs. Royals odds\n\n\n### 🧢 Dodgers vs. Royals starting pitchers\n\n-   **Dodgers:** Dustin May (4-5, 4.46 ERA)\n-   **Royals:** Noah Cameron (2-3, 2.08 ERA)\n\n\n### 💰 Dodgers vs. Royals prediction & best bet\n\n*✅ Best bet: Royals +1.5\n📊 Best odds: -120 via bet365 ($10 to win $8.33)**\n\nEach product featured on our website has been meticulously researched and selected by our team of experts.

That's how he's managed to last at least five innings in all eight starts while allowing multiple runs just twice.\n\nThe same can't be said for May, who has been hit hard all year and gave up three home runs in his last start against the Washington Nationals. While the Royals' bats have been blanked in two straight contests, I think they'll find enough open grass tonight - while leaning on a lights-out bullpen - to keep it close or even win outright.\n\n\n## 💡 More MLB predictions today\n\n-   [Home run predictions](https://www.sportsbookreview.com/picks/mlb/best-home-run-predictions-odds-today-june-27-2025/)\n-   [Best NRFI bets today](https://www.sportsbookreview.com/picks/mlb/best-nrfi-bets-today-june-27-2025/)\n-   [Rays vs. Orioles prediction](https://www.sportsbookreview.com/picks/mlb/rays-vs-orioles-prediction-odds-best-bets-june-27-2025/)\n-   [Phillies vs. Braves prediction](https://www.sportsbookreview.com/picks/mlb/phillies-vs-braves-prediction-odds-best-bets-june-27-2025/)\n-   Dodgers vs. Royals prediction\n\n\n## 💵 Best MLB betting sites\n\nWant to bet on Dodgers vs. Royals?

He allowed three earned runs over six innings in a loss to the Nationals in his last start.\n\nCameron is slumping while having dropped each of his last four outings. He's looking to break that skid after having allowed two earned runs over 5 ⅓ innings in a loss to the Padres.\n\nHere's how I'm approaching this game with a player prop and game prediction. \n\n[_Odds via FanDuel Sportsbook_](https://bit.ly/3Q4vm8c)\n\n*Run Line**\n\n*Moneyline**\n\n*Total**\n\nFor what it's worth, May has bumped his strikeout rate up a few percentage points this season to 21.2%. His arsenal is much healthier than it was two seasons ago, putting away hitters with his sweeper at a 12% higher clip and a 10% improvement on his cutter. He's still no strikeout threat, hence the 3.5 line on his prop Friday. But the Royals are the fourth-most swinging team in the game. May's swing-and-miss numbers aren't special, but he's eclipsed this line in seven of his last nine starts.\n\nBoth of these teams clash with polar opposite fortunes as of late, but I'm confident enough in what Cameron is delivering despite taking losses in four straight starts. The Royals simply lack the run support behind him, ranking dead last in runs per game. And if there's one guy in this Kansas City rotation that can mute the Dodgers' slugging potential, it's Cameron, who boasts a 0.97 HR/9 and 7.1% HR/FB. Besides, Kauffman Stadium is one of the game's most difficult home run ballparks, which could further cap any damage from their deep lineup.\n\nMay has consistently limited barrel damage (under .350 xwOBA allowed) and I don't see that changing against one of Statcast's worst contact hitting teams in the Royals in Friday's matchup. \n\n*Pick: Under 9.5 (**[**\\-104 at FanDuel**](https://bit.ly/3Q4vm8c)**)**\n\n*FanDuel**\n\nCreate a new FanDuel Sportsbook account, and you can get [**$150 in bonus bets if you win your first $5 wager**](https://bit.ly/3Q4vm8c).

Tonight, the New York Mets are set to face off against the Pittsburgh Pirates in what promises to be an intriguing matchup for fans and analysts alike.\n\nLet's start with the pitching duel. The Mets will send David Peterson to the mound. With a solid record of 5-3 and an ERA hovering around 3.3, he has demonstrated his ability to keep hitters at bay effectively this season. His strikeout capability is impressive as well; averaging over eight strikeouts per nine innings speaks volumes about his capacity to dominate opposing batters. On the flip side, Mitch Keller will be toeing the rubber for Pittsburgh. Unfortunately for him and Pirates fans, his win-loss record of 1-10 reflects a season riddled with challenges on the mound despite having an ERA of around 4.0 that shows he isn't entirely ineffective.\n\nWhen analyzing their offensive performance this season, it's clear why oddsmakers opened up with Mets as -175 favorites. The Mets have averaged just over four runs per game and boast nearly eight hits each outing-significantly better than Pittsburgh's offense, which has struggled mightily with only about three runs per game and a batting average lingering around .225. The Mets' ability to get on base (over 72% slugging) compared to Pittsburgh's numbers signals trouble for Keller tonight.\n\nLooking back through my coaching years, I've often emphasized how critical it is for pitchers to find their rhythm early in games. If Keller can't locate his pitches or fall behind in counts against aggressive hitters from New York-who have proven they can capitalize on mistakes-we may witness another tough night for him on home soil.\n\nThe recent trends also tell us quite a story: while New York has been gaining some momentum winning four out of its last six games ATS (against the spread), Pittsburgh finds itself struggling with only three wins out of their last eleven games overall. This kind of disparity usually leads me to favor teams like New York who seem poised and prepared.\n\nDefensively speaking, both teams have had ups and downs this season; however, what stands out is how effective Peterson has been when he takes control of the game early versus Keller's propensity to surrender those early runs which could shift momentum quickly in favor of New York.\n\nAll indicators point towards expecting more action tonight than usual given both teams' recent trends-in particular how consistently high-scoring games have been lately with Pittsburgh going OVER in seven of their last nine outings combined with New York's recent performance spikes at plate activity.\n\nMy prediction? Expect the Mets to pull off a victory here against an underperforming Pirates squad while scoring over that total line set at 8.5 runs should push towards being reachable too due mainly to offensive firepower from both sides-a perfect recipe for fireworks at PNC Park tonight!\n\n\n**Strikeout Kings — K Prop Cheat Sheet - Yahoo Sports**\nThe writer has compiled a list of the best pitchers to pitch in 2015.

He has been hot of late, with a .333 batting average and 5 home runs in his last 10 games.\n\nThe Pirates' hitter most likely to record at least one hit is **Oneil Cruz**, who has a .239 batting average and 13 home runs this season. He has been struggling lately, but he has a strong track record against right-handed pitchers, with a .260 batting average and 10 home runs in 2025.\n\n**Current runline and moneyline for the game**\n\nThe current runline and moneyline for the Mets vs. Pirates game are:\n\n*   **Run line**: Mets -1.5 (+104) | Pirates +1.5 (-126)\n*   **Moneyline**: Mets -161 | Pirates +129\n\n**Which side of each line—runline and moneyline—offers the most value**\n\nBased on my analysis, I recommend taking the **Pirates +1.5** (-126) and **under 8.5** (-114). The Pirates have been struggling lately, but Mitch Keller has been impressive in his starts, and I think he can keep the Mets' offense in check. The under has hit in three of the Pirates' last five games, and I expect a low-scoring game.\n\n**3-leg parlay that combines strikeout totals, hitter outcomes, and either the runline or moneyline**\n\nHere is a 3-leg parlay that combines strikeout totals, hitter outcomes, and the runline:\n\n*   **Mitch Keller 4+ strikeouts**: Keller has recorded 4+ strikeouts in five of his last seven starts.\n*   **Juan Soto 1+ hit**: Soto has a strong track record against right-handed pitchers and is likely to get at least one hit.\n*   **Pirates +1.5**: The Pirates have been struggling lately, but I think they can keep it close against the Mets.\n\nThis parlay offers a good balance of strikeout totals, hitter outcomes, and the runline. If you're looking for a more conservative play, you could substitute **under 8.5** (-114) for the Pirates +1.5 leg.",

It was ultimately a win for the Yankee ace, and Carlos Rodón will look to achieve the same result tonight at the Coliseum. Oakland will hand the ball to lefty JP Sears, and if you have a sense of déjà vu looking at the starting pitching matchup, that would be really impressive - how did you remember that these two starters faced each other in the Bronx back on [April 22nd](https://www.pinstripealley.com/2024/4/22/24137441/yankees-mlb-game-recap-boone-ejection-shutout-mason-miller-athletics-jp-sears-judge-soto-rodon-volpe)?\n\nIf you _don't_ remember this game, no worries. There wasn't too much to remember. Both Rodón (7 IP, 0 R, 1 H, 2 BB, 4 K) and Sears (6 IP, 0 R, 3 H, 1 BB, 7 K) pitched brilliantly, but the now-departed Victor González allowed a late home run to Zack Gelof, and that was that. The Yanks were shut out 2-0, as they got their first taste of Mason Miller in the ninth.\n\nBoth Rodón and Sears have had up-and-down seasons since that first meeting in April, but Rodón has pitched better of late, with a 2.60 ERA in three September starts. His most recent outing was a perfectly cromulent effort against Boston in which he earned his 15th win of the season on 5.1 innings of two-run ball. Sears has a 4.50 mark in three starts of his own this month, which includes the ignominious honor of losing to the 2024 White Sox his last time out.\n\nMore good news for the [Yankees](https://www.pinstripealley.com/) on the division front: the Orioles lost 6-4 to the Tigers in 10 innings earlier tonight. That means the magic number for the division can get to three with a win tonight.\n\nJuan Soto is back in the lineup after getting the first nine innings off last night. He bats in his usual No. 2 spot with Aaron Judge behind him. Jon Berti fills in for Jazz Chisholm Jr. at third, as does Jose Trevino for Austin Wells at catcher. Sears has been highly effective against southpaws this year, so it's no surprise that Aaron Boone, who can never resist a good platoon, made those changes tonight (in addition to Oswaldo Cabrera tagging in for Anthony Rizzo at first). Chisholm and Wells are in 9-for-56 (.161) and 7-for-52 (.135) skids at the plate anyway, so perhaps a breather will help them in the long run. Lefty starters have continued to be a trouble spot for this Yankee lineup; they'll look to rise to the occasion against the former Yankee farmhand in Oaktown.\n\n*How to watch**\n\n*Location**: Oakland Coliseum - Oakland, CA\n\n*First pitch**: 9:07 pm ET\n\n*TV broadcast**: YES, NBCSCA\n\n*Radio broadcast**: WFAN 660/101.9 FM, WADO 1280\n\n*Online stream**: MLB.tv (out-of-market)\n\nFor updates, follow us on [Twitter](https://x.com/pinstripealley) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pinstripealley/), and like us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pinstripealley).\n\n\n**Athletics vs. Yankees (Jun 27, 2025) Pregame - ESPN**\nAthletics (33-50, fifth in the AL West) vs. New York Yankees (46-34, first in the AL East)\n\nNew York; Friday, 7:05 p.m. EDT\n\nPITCHING PROBABLES: Athletics: Mitch Spence (2-2, 3.84 ERA, 1.29 WHIP, 50 strikeouts); Yankees: Will Warren (4-4, 4.66 ERA, 1.33 WHIP, 96 strikeouts)\n\nYankees -211, Athletics +174; over/under is 8 1/2 runs\n\nBOTTOM LINE: The New York Yankees take on the Athletics after Jasson Dominguez had four hits against the Reds on Wednesday.\n\nNew York has a 24-16 record in home games and a 46-34 record overall.

This time, they're facing off against the [Athletics](https://www.si.com/mlb/athletics/news/new-york-yankees-to-face-three-former-yankees-a-s-rotation-this-weekend) from Yankee Stadium. The pitching lineup for the Athletics features several familiar faces. In fact, every starting pitcher this weekend has a Yankees connection.\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Yankee Will Warren takes on A's pitcher Mitch Spence. Spence has an 3.84 ERA in 26 games (but only 58.2 innings). In contrast, Warren has a 4.66 ERA through 16 games and 75.1 innings.\n\nThe Pinstripes drafted Spence in the 10th round of the 2019 MLB draft. He spent a few years in New York's farm system, before ultimately making his major league debut with the Athletics last season.\n\nOn the mound for the A's on Saturday is fourth-year lefty JP Sears. Sears played for the Pinstripes in 2022, when he was dealt to the Athletics after pitching in seven games and starting two. He's been with the A's ever since.\n\nSears hasn't been doing too terribly well lately, with an 8.72 ERA in his last seven games. He'll be up against [Clarke Schmidt](https://www.si.com/mlb/yankees/news/new-york-yankees-clarke-schmidt-explains-recent-dominance) from the Yankees, offering a 1.67 ERA in _his_ last seven outings. While he faced some difficulties earlier in the season, he was absolutely [dominant](https://www.si.com/fannation/mlb/fastball/history/new-york-yankees-pitcher-clarke-schmidt-tosses-gem-vs-baltimore-orioles-to-extend-historic-hot-streak-01jyagym080b) against the Cincinnati Reds this week.\n\nOn Sunday, Luis Severino returns to Yankee Stadium to face off against his former team. He spent eight seasons with the Pinstripes from 2015 to 2023, before being sent to their crosstown rival, The New York Mets. The Mets kept him on for one season before dealing him to the Athletics.\n\nWhile there's no official announcement for Sunday's matchup just yet, many predict that [Carlos Rodón](https://www.si.com/mlb/yankees/news/brutal-heat-wave-melts-new-york-yankees-star-carlos-rodon) will take the mound against Severino, especially if Marcus Stroman isn't ready for his return. Rodón has excelled this season, offering a 2.92 ERA in 17 games. Severino has a 4.83 ERA in the same number of games, and exactly one fewer inning. Should he start for the Yankees, it'll be a can't-miss matchup.\n\n[_Make sure to bookmark Yankees On SI to get all your daily New York Yankees news, interviews, breakdowns and more!_](https://www.si.com/mlb/yankees)\n\n",

He has been hot of late, with a .400 batting average and 3 home runs in his last 10 games.\n\nThe Athletics' hitter most likely to record at least one hit is **Brent Rooker**, who has a .273 batting average and 16 home runs this season. He has been struggling lately, but he has a strong track record against right-handed pitchers, with a .300 batting average and 10 home runs in 2025.\n\n**Current runline and moneyline for the game**\n\nThe current runline and moneyline for the Athletics vs. Yankees game are:\n\n*   **Run line**: Yankees -1.5 (+104) | Athletics +1.5 (-126)\n*   **Moneyline**: Yankees -213 | Athletics +176\n\n**Which side of each line—runline and moneyline—offers the most value**\n\nBased on my analysis, I recommend taking the **Yankees -1.5** (+104) and **under 8.0** (-108).

If you're looking for a more conservative play, you could substitute **under 8.0** (-108) for the Yankees -1.5 leg.",

Offensively, they sit in the middle of the pack with a .720 team OPS that ranks 13th in MLB. They have 83 home runs, which is surprisingly low for a team that plays at hitter-friendly Minute Maid Park.\n\nThe Cubs will dodge a major bullet this series with slugger [Yordan Àlvarez](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/alvaryo01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.cubsinsider.com&utm_campaign=2025-06-27_br) currently on the injured list with a broken hand.

That latter mark is the best in baseball. The starting rotation has had a ton of injuries, but it still has a 3.52 ERA. [Framber Valdez](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/v/valdefr01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.cubsinsider.com&utm_campaign=2025-06-27_br) is having another excellent year and [Hunter Brown](https://www.baseball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=brownhu01,brown-006hun,brown-009hun,brown-008hun&search=Hunter+Brown&utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.cubsinsider.com&utm_campaign=2025-06-27_br) has the lowest ERA in baseball. The Cubs won't see Brown, but they will have to face Valdez on Sunday.\n\nHouston has the second-best bullpen in the league as closer [Josh Hader](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/haderjo01.shtml?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.cubsinsider.com&utm_campaign=2025-06-27_br) continues to dominate with a 1.73 ERA and 21 saves.

The North Siders bounced back nicely from a tough stretch with a couple of impressive wins in St. Louis, now they need to continue that strong play to get over .500 on the trip.\n\n*Game Time and Broadcast Info**\n\n\n-   Friday, June 27 at 7:10pm CT on Marquee.\n-   Saturday, June 28 at 6:15pm CT on FOX.\n-   Sunday, June 29 at 1:10pm CT on Marquee.\n\n*Starting Pitchers**\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n      \"0\": \"Date\",\n      \"1\": \"Pitcher\",\n      \"2\": \"Age\",\n      \"3\": \"T\",\n      \"4\": \"ERA\",\n      \"5\": \"W/L\",\n      \"6\": \"FIP\",\n      \"7\": \"K/BB\"\n    },\n      \"0\": \"6/27\",\n      \"1\": \"Cade Horton\",\n      \"2\": \"23\",\n      \"3\": \"R\",\n      \"4\": \"3.73\",\n      \"5\": \"3-1\",\n      \"6\": \"3.78\",\n      \"7\": \"3.10\"\n      \"0\": \"\",\n      \"1\": \"Brandon Walter\",\n      \"2\": \"28\",\n      \"3\": \"L\",\n      \"4\": \"3.80\",\n      \"5\": \"0-1\",\n      \"6\": \"3.76\",\n      \"7\": \"12.50\"\n      \"0\": \"6/28\",\n      \"1\": \"Colin Rea\",\n      \"2\": \"34\",\n      \"4\": \"4.42\",\n      \"5\": \"4-3\",\n      \"6\": \"4.76\",\n      \"7\": \"2.84\"\n      \"1\": \"TBA\",\n      \"2\": \"\",\n      \"3\": \"\",\n      \"4\": \"\",\n      \"5\": \"\",\n      \"6\": \"\",\n      \"7\": \"\"\n      \"0\": \"6/29\",\n      \"1\": \"Jameson Taillon\",\n      \"2\": \"33\",\n      \"4\": \"4.47\",\n      \"5\": \"7-5\",\n      \"6\": \"5.17\",\n      \"7\": \"3.68\"\n      \"1\": \"Framber Valdez\",\n      \"2\": \"31\",\n      \"4\": \"2.88\",\n      \"5\": \"8-4\",\n      \"6\": \"3.04\",\n      \"7\": \"2.76\"\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\n*What to Watch For**\n\n-   [Michael Busch](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/buschmi02.shtml?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.cubsinsider.com&utm_campaign=2025-06-27_br) had four hits, including a home run, in his last two games.\n-   [Carson Kelly](https://www.baseball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=kellyca02,kelly-005car,kelly-004car&search=Carson+Kelly&utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.cubsinsider.com&utm_campaign=2025-06-27_br) has six hits in his last four games after slumping.\n-   Taillon and Rea each got beat up in their last starts.\n\n",

The matchup begins at 9:38 p.m. ET.\n\nThe probable pitchers are Jose Soriano (5-5) for the Angels and Jake Irvin (6-3) for the Nationals.\n\n---\n\nThe Angels face the Nationals in the National League on Friday, June 27, at 8:30 p.m. ET. The game will be played between the Angels and the Nationals at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, California. The Angels are seeking to win their first game since the start of the season.\n\n\n**Game 82 lineups: Nats at Angels - Blog**\nANAHEIM, Calif. - Hello from the Big A and the final leg of this three-city Southern California swing for the Nationals. They lost two of three in Los Angeles. They lost two of three in San Diego. They really hope not to lose two of three here against an Angels team that is playing good baseball and has reached the .500 mark but just learned today manager Ron Washington will miss the remainder of the season while on medical leave. Bench coach Ray Montgomery takes over managerial duties.\n\nThe Nationals were shut out Wednesday by the Padres, so they'll be looking to bounce back offensively against José Soriano. The right-hander has a good ERA (3.39) but so-so peripherals (1.419 WHIP, 7.7 strikeouts per nine innings, 4.2 walks per nine innings). That final number needs to be implanted in the Nats' brains. They did not draw one walk during Wednesday's loss. They have to show more patience tonight.\n\nOn the mound, Jake Irvin is coming off a really solid start at Dodger Stadium (two runs, seven strikeouts, zero walks) in 5 1/3 innings. He makes his first career start against the Angels, so this will be the first time he ever faces Mike Trout (and vice versa).\n\n*WASHINGTON NATIONALS at LOS ANGELES ANGELS\nWhere:** Angel Stadium\n*Gametime:** 9:38 p.m. EDT\n*TV:** MASN, MLB.tv\n*Radio:** 106.7 FM, 87.7 FM (Spanish), MLB.com\n*Weather:** Clear, 74 degrees, wind 8 mph out to center field\n\n*NATIONALS\n*SS CJ Abrams\nLF James Wood\n2B Luis García Jr.\n1B Nathaniel Lowe\nDH Josh Bell\n3B Brady House\nRF Daylen Lile\nC Riley Adams\nCF Jacob Young\n\nRHP Jake Irvin\n\n*ANGELS\n*3B Luis Rengifo\n1B Nolan Schanuel\nDH Mike Trout\nLF Taylor Ward\nCF Jo Adell\nC Logan O'Hoppe\nRF Lamonte Wade Jr.\n2B Christian Moore\nSS Kevin Newman\n\nRHP José Soriano\n\n\n**Angels vs. Nationals prediction, pick for Friday 6/27/25**\nKeagan Smith takes you through his preview, prediction, and pick for Wednesday's game between the Angels and Nationals.\n\nThe Los Angeles [Angels](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/teams/baseball/mlb/los-angeles-angels--odds?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=262069&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork) are coming off a three-game sweep of the Boston [Red Sox](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/teams/baseball/mlb/boston-red-sox--odds?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=262069&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork) as they head into Friday's series opener against the [Washington Nationals](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/teams/baseball/mlb/washington-nationals--odds?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=262069&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork). Have the Halos found their form going into this homestand against a lowly opponent, or will the visitors strike first to take the opening game?\n\nHere's an Angels vs. Nationals prediction and pick on DraftKings [Sportsbook](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=262069&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork) for Friday night's late-slate action.\n\n---\n\n## Angels vs. Nationals prediction, preview\n\n\n### Los Angeles Angels\n\nAfter successfully clawing their way to the .500 mark with their last series, the Angels now sit 40-40 on the season and third place among the AL West. They're now just one game back of the Seattle [Mariners](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/teams/baseball/mlb/seattle-mariners--odds?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=262069&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork) for second, so even non-division games like tonight suddenly matter a little bit more than they did a few weeks back.\n\nThe Angels don't hit particularly well and rank bottom-five in AVG and OBP, also sitting second-worst in strikeouts and walks. However, the one thing they do well is smack the cover off the ball with 118 home runs, the fourth-highest tally of any team. They still fall 19th in runs scored though, so there's not a ton of support for a pitching staff which falls 24th in ERA and 28th in WHIP on the year.\n\n\n### Washington Nationals\n\nAs for the visiting Nationals, their 33-48 record doesn't indicate much to be excited about at the bottom of the NL East. They're just 3-7 across their last 10 games, but there are a couple of bright spots this year in James Wood's breakout, CJ Abrams' excellence and the emergence of MacKenzie Gore's improvement into a standout hurler.\n\nThe Nats' bats rank 22nd in AVG, 21st in OPS and 17th in runs on this season. Their offense feels feisty enough to make games interesting on occasion, but much like the Angels, Wahington's arms struggle more than most teams. At 28th in ERA and 24th in WHIP, they need a more consistent stable of pitchers before they can truly make some noise and return to the playoffs.\n\n\n## Angels vs. Nationals pick, best bet\n\nThe Angels are -171 favorites on the [Moneyline](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/how-to-bet-moneyline?dkinternal_referrer_article_id=262069&dkinternal_referrer_source=DKNetwork) at their own ballpark this evening while the Nationals hold +140 odds of an outright win. The run total sits at 8.5 between these two teams.\n\nRight-hander Jose Soriano draws the start for Los Angeles this evening. He's thrown 93.0 innings across 16 starts this year with a 3.39 ERA and 1.42 WHIP along with 80 strikeouts. He duels against Washington righty Jake Irvin, who posts a 4.18 ERA, 1.23 WHIP and 66 punchouts across 94.2 innings.\n\nAs for tonight's best bet, I'm targeting the Angels' starting arm. Soriano has very quietly been hot during the month of June. Over his 24.1 innings this month, the right-hander's ERA sits at 3.33 with a 1.15 WHIP and 31 strikeouts. He posted at least six strikeouts in three of his four outings with 10 and 12 Ks in a couple of those.

      "content": "**1–2 hitters from each team who are most likely to record at least one hit, using current batting averages, left/right matchup splits, and performance against the opposing pitcher**\n\nThe Angels' hitter most likely to record at least one hit is **Mike Trout**, who has a .326 batting average and 19 home runs this season. He has been hot of late, with a .400 batting average and 3 home runs in his last 10 games.\n\nThe Nationals' hitter most likely to record at least one hit is **James Wood**, who has a .275 batting average and 22 home runs this season. He has been struggling lately, but he has a strong track record against right-handed pitchers, with a .300 batting average and 10 home runs in 2025.\n\n**Current runline and moneyline for the game**\n\nThe current runline and moneyline for the Angels vs. Nationals game are:\n\n*   **Run line**: Angels -1.5 (+104) | Nationals +1.5 (-126)\n*   **Moneyline**: Angels -164 | Nationals +138\n\n**Which side of each line—runline and moneyline—offers the most value**\n\nBased on my analysis, I recommend taking the **Angels -1.5** (+104) and **under 8.0** (-108). The Angels have been dominant at home, with a 24-16 record in games played at Angel Stadium. The under has hit in six of the Angels' last eight games, and I expect a low-scoring game.\n\n**3-leg parlay that combines strikeout totals, hitter outcomes, and either the runline or moneyline**\n\nHere is a 3-leg parlay that combines strikeout totals, hitter outcomes, and the runline:\n\n*   **José Soriano 6+ strikeouts**: Soriano has recorded 6+ strikeouts in three of his last five starts.\n*   **Mike Trout 1+ hit**: Trout has a strong track record against left-handed pitchers and is likely to get at least one hit.\n*   **Angels -1.5**: The Angels have been dominant at home, and I think they can keep it close or even win outright.\n\nThis parlay offers a good balance of strikeout totals, hitter outcomes, and the runline. If you're looking for a more conservative play, you could substitute **under 8.0** (-108) for the Angels -1.5 leg.",
