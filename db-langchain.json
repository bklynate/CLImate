If he exercises the opt‑out, the remaining 10 years become a new contract that can be renegotiated or re‑signed. |\n| **No‑Trade Provision** | Full **no‑trade clause** – Soto cannot be traded without his consent. |\n| **Other Notable Provisions** | • No reported “player option” beyond the five‑year opt‑out.<br>• No salary arbitration rights (the contract supersedes any future arbitration eligibility).<br>• The Mets retain all rights to a possible extension or renegotiation after the opt‑out, but Soto would be free to test free agency at that point. |\n| **Context** | • At the time of signing, it surpassed Shohei Ohtani’s $700 M (16‑year) deal as the biggest MLB contract ever.<br>• The Mets reportedly offered a “home‑run‑friendly” schedule and a competitive roster to entice Soto away from other suitors (Yankees, Dodgers, Red Sox, Blue Jays).<br>• The offer was widely reported by MLB.com, Spotrac, and major news outlets. |\n\n### Quick Takeaways\n- **Financially**: $765 M over 15 years = roughly $51 M per year, making Soto the highest‑paid player on an annual basis in baseball history.  \n- **Flexibility for Soto**: The five‑year opt‑out gives him a chance to re‑enter free agency (or renegotiate) while still in his prime, preserving leverage if market values rise further.  \n- **Team Control**: The full no‑trade clause locks the Mets into keeping Soto unless he agrees, providing roster stability for the franchise.  \n\nIf you need more granular breakdowns (year‑by‑year salary schedule, comparison with other recent mega‑deals, or implications for the Mets’ payroll and luxury‑tax calculations), just let me know!",
