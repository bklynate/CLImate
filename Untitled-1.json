Additionally, identify 1–2 hitters from each team who are most likely to record at least one hit, using current batting averages, left/right matchup splits, and performance against the opposing pitcher. Include the current runline and moneyline for the game, and based on your overall analysis, determine which side of each line—runline and moneyline—offers the most value. Finally, using your projections and reasoning, construct a 3-leg parlay that combines strikeout totals, hitter outcomes, and either the runline or moneyline. Clearly explain your reasoning for each leg of the parlay and cite all relevant stats used to support your picks.",

However, I need more information about the current runline and moneyline for the game to determine which side of each line offers the most value.\n\nThe Orioles' probable pitcher is Trevor Rogers, and the Cubs' probable pitcher is not specified in the search results. For the sake of analysis, let's assume that the Cubs' starting pitcher is someone with a moderate strikeout rate.\n\nRecent form and matchup history suggest that Trevor Rogers might have an advantage over the Cubs' lineup, potentially leading to 7-8 strikeouts. On the other hand, the Cubs' starting pitcher could be expected to have around 5-6 strikeouts against the Orioles.\n\nAs for hitters, Cedric Mullins and Ryan O'Hearn from the Orioles are likely to perform well against the Cubs' pitching, considering their current batting averages and left/right matchup splits. From the Cubs, players like Seiya Suzuki or Christopher Morel might have an edge against Trevor Rogers, given their past performance against him.\n\nHowever, without real-time data on the current runline and moneyline, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer on which side of each line offers the most value. Typically, if the runline is close (e.g., -1.5 or +1.5), and considering the potential for both teams to score runs, taking the underdog with a favorable matchup might be a good strategy.\n\nFor constructing a 3-leg parlay, I would consider combining:\n\n1. **Trevor Rogers Over 7.5 Strikeouts**: Given his recent form and the Cubs' lineup vulnerabilities.\n2. **Cedric Mullins to Record at Least One Hit**: Based on his current batting average and performance against right-handed pitchers.\n3. **Orioles +1.5 on the Runline**: Assuming the game is closely contested, and the Orioles have a good chance of keeping it within one run or winning outright.\n\nPlease note that these picks are speculative without real-time data and should be adjusted according to the most current information available.",
