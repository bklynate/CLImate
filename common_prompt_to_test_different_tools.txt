The Marlins and Orioles are playing today. Based on recent form, matchup history, and historical averages,
estimate strikeouts for each starting pitcher. Additionally, identify 1–2 hitters from each team who are most likely to record at least one hit,
using current batting averages, left/right matchup splits, and performance against the opposing pitcher.
Include the current runline and moneyline for the game, and based on your overall analysis,
determine which side of each line—runline and moneyline—offers the most value. Finally, 
using your projections and reasoning, construct a 3-leg parlay that combines strikeout totals, hitter outcomes,
and either the runline or moneyline. 
Clearly explain your reasoning for each leg of the parlay and cite all relevant stats used to support your picks.
